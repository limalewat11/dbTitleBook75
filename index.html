Whereas most who stand on the side of religion lack the technical expertise to know science "from inside," scientists and writers on science are, as a rule, blind to their own metaphysical assumptions, and woefully inept when it comes to subtle metaphysical points. Not so for Professor Smith, who moves easily between these two essential ways of knowing: between the core twentieth-century discipline of physics, and metaphysical doctrine as articulated by the sapiential traditions of mankind.<br> <br>In <i>Science &amp; Myth</i> the author shows that science too has its mythology, unrecognized and unacknowledged though the fact be. Starting with a profound clarification of this basic issue he goes on to explain the metaphysical significance of scientific findings relating to visual perception, the relation of neurons to mind, and much else, all of which leads up to the central chapter on Stephen Hawking's best-selling book,<i> The Grand Design</i>. Professor Smith first presents Hawking's case, summarizing his entire argument -- in which Hawking claims that the very existence of the universe can be explained on scientific grounds -- and then proceeds with a magisterial point-by-point rebuttal that leaves his grand thesis in tatters. <i>Science &amp; Myth</i> is a must-read for all those concerned with contemporary issues of science and religion.</p><p><br>After graduating from Cornell University at age eighteen with majors in physics, mathematics and philosophy, Wolfgang Smith took an M.S. from Purdue, following which he spent three years at Bell Aircraft Corporation as an aerodynamicist. During this period he gained recognition for his pioneering papers on the effect of diffusion fields, which provided a theoretical solution to the re-entry problem for space flight. After receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics from Columbia University, Dr. Smith pursued a professorial career in that field. Soon however his center of interest shifted from the pursuit of science to the critique of scientism and the rediscovery of metaphysics as a theological discipline. He has authored six books and numerous articles, and is today widely recognized as a leading authority in these twin fields."Wolfgang Smith is as important a thinker as our times boast." --Huston Smith, author of <i>The World's Religions</i><br><br>"Wolfgang Smith broaches a vast range of subjects with a mastery that bespeaks an immense culture." --Jean Borella, author of <i>The Sense of the Supernatural </i>and <i>The Secret of the Christian Way</i><br><br>"Here is that rare person who is equally at home with Eckhart and Einstein, Heraclitus and Heisenberg!" --Harry Oldmeadow, author of <i>Touchstones of the Spirit: Essays on Religion, Tradition &amp; Modernity</i></p><h2>Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</h2><p>Book may have numerous typos, missing text, images, or index.

Money as distinguished from coin, the result of the circulation process C--M--C, forms the starting point of the circulation process M--C--M, i. e. the exchange of money for commodity in order to exchange commodity for money. In the form C--M--C, commodity forms the starting and final points of the movement; in the form M--C--M, money plays that part. In the former case money is the medium of exchange of commodities, in the latter the commodity helps money to become money. Money which appears merely as a means of circulation in the first form becomes an end in the second form; while commodity which appeared first as the end, now becomes but a means. Since money is itself the result of circulation C--M--C, the result of circulation appears at the same time as its starting point in the form M--C--M.</p><p><p>Described as one of the most influential figures in human history, Karl Marx was a German philosopher and economist who wrote extensively on the benefits of socialism and the flaws of free-market capitalism. His most notable works, Das Kapital and The Communist Manifesto (the latter of which was co-authored by his collaborator Friedrich Engels), have since become two of history s most important political and economic works. Marxism the term that has come to define the philosophical school of thought encompassing Marx s ideas about society, politics and economics was the foundation for the socialist movements of the twentieth century, including Leninism, Stalinism, Trotskyism, and Maoism. Despite the negative reputation associated with some of these movements and with Communism in general, Marx s view of a classless socialist society was a utopian one which did not include the possibility of dictatorship. Greatly influenced by the philosopher G. W. F. Hegel, Marx wrote in radical newspapers from his young adulthood, and can also be credited with founding the philosophy of dialectical materialism. Marx died in London in 1883 at the age of 64.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Roman Catholics and Evangelicals: Agreements and Differences</h2><p>This comparative study shows that Protestants and Catholics are not as separated theologically as they may think.

In the wake of the 500th anniversary of Columbus's ``discovery'' of the New World, few historians are resisting the urge to attack the European exploitation of North America. Morgan (An Uncertain Hour, 1989, etc.) is no exception: For him, ``grand larceny'' might be more appropriate than ``settling'' to describe the European seizure of the continent. He emphasizes, for instance, French Jesuits' disruption of Indian culture rather than their zeal or physical courage. Morgan is short on analysis here, however, offering no real understanding of how the major American cities blossomed, or why North America, with all its problems, continued to attract settlers. He uses a variety of contemporary diaries, letters, and other documents to flesh out his story, which ranges from the Stone Age crossing of the Bering Land Bridge to the early 19th century. Morgan aims to write ``the story of mail carriers, sodbusters, circuit-riding judges, and Indian agents, of the people too busy occupying the land to make a claim on history.'' Although he veers a bit from his view from history's bottom rail (La Salle, the Virginian aristocrat William Byrd II, and Pilgrim governor William Bradford all receive excellent coverage), the author relates many an offbeat, sometimes jaunty, tale of ordinary people- -including Edward Marshall, whose marathon 60-mile walk in a day and a half helped William Penn's descendants swindle choice Pennsylvania land from the Indians; Eliza Lucas, who transformed the Carolinas' economy by introducing indigo; and Pop&#x160;, the outraged shaman who masterminded the 1680 Pueblo revolt--the only Indian rebellion that successfully expelled a colonial power. Not strong on the reasons for European settlement, but a vivid panorama that makes one look forward to Morgan's projected next volume in this saga. (Four maps) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this "collective biography of ordinary Americans," Morgan ( FDR ) offers an involving, if a bit disjointed, popular history of North America to the end of the 18th century. He draws on memoirs, journals and academic studies for his colloquial, panoramic narrative; his anecdotes mainly eschew the famous for intriguing characters like William Fitzhugh, who in 1674 built a 13-room house, complete with Turkish carpets, on Virginia's "gentrified" northern frontier. As Morgan covers the advances of the European powers and the formation of the United States, he does not ignore the many depredations of the powerful. But the French-born author is, above all, an American enthusiast, and he concludes by celebrating the emerging nation's egalitarianism and "spirit of enterprise." Sometimes, however, Morgan's search for relevance--as when he links colonial tobacco propaganda to 20th-century ads for "Marlboro Country"--seems strained, and he makes few attempts to apprise the reader of ongoing debates about historical interpretation.

Commissaire Jean-Baptiste Adamsberg, the chief of police in Paris's 7th Arrondissement, is deeply and personally familiar with the case, and though others were always framed and convicted for these crimes, including his own brother, the Commissaire knows the true identity of the killer&#x2014;and knows that the murderer died in 1987.

On a Saturday, October 4, when the outside temperature had dropped to one degree Celsius, as cold air had arrived from the Arctic. The <i>commissaire</i> knew nothing about heating systems, and was examining the silent tank and pipework, in the hope that his benign gaze would either restore the boiler&#x2019;s energy or perhaps conjure up the engineer, who was supposed to be there but hadn&#x2019;t turned up.<br><br>Not that he felt the cold, nor was he distressed by the situation. On the contrary, the idea that the north wind should sometimes come funnelling down from the polar ice cap to the streets of the 13th <i>arrondissement </i>of Paris gave him the sensation that he was only one step away from the frozen wastes, that he could walk across them and dig a hole to hunt seals, if he felt like it. He had put on a pullover under his black jacket, and if it was up to him, he would have waited patiently for the repairman to come, while watching for the whiskers of a seal to pop up out of the ice.<br><br>But in its own way, the powerful heating system down in the basement was a full-time participant in the handling of the cases that poured in all day long to the Paris Serious Crime Squad, as it conveyed its warmth to the thirty-four radiators and twenty-eight police officers in the building. The said officers were at present shivering with cold, huddled into anoraks and crowding round the coffee machine, warming their gloved hands on the white beakers. Or else they had simply left the building for one of the nearby bars. Their files were consequently frozen solid too. Important files, dealing with violent crimes. But the boiler wasn&#x2019;t concerned with all that. It was simply waiting, in lordly and tyrannical fashion, for the man with the magic touch to arrive and kneel in front of it. So as a gesture of goodwill, Adamsberg had gone downstairs to pay it brief and unsuccessful homage, and in particular to find a quiet dark place where he could escape from the complaints of his colleagues.<br><br>Their curses at the cold, since the inside temperature was, after all, about 10 degrees, did not augur well for the vote on the proposed DNA profiling course in Quebec, where the autumn was turning out severe &#x2014; minus 4 yesterday in Ottawa, and it was already snowing in places. They were being offered two weeks&#x2019; full-time study of genetic imprints, using saliva, blood, sweat, tears, urine and other excretions, now captured on electronic circuits, classified and broken down. All body fluids had become battleground weapons in criminology. A week before the planned departure date, Adamsberg&#x2019;s thoughts had already taken off towards the Canadian forests, which he had been told were immense and dotted with millions of lakes. His second-in-command, <i>Capitaine</i> Danglard, had reminded him crossly that they would be staring at computer screens, not gazing out over lakes. Danglard had been angry with him for a year now. Adamsberg knew why, and was waiting patiently for the grumbling to subside.<br><br>Danglard was not dreaming about lakes, but praying every day that some urgent case would keep the entire squad back home. For weeks he had been imagining his imminent death, as the plane blew up over the Atlantic. But since the heating engineer had failed to arrive, he had cheered up somewhat. He was hoping that the unforeseen breakdown of the boiler and the sudden cold snap would put paid to the absurd idea of travelling to Canada&#x2019;s icy wastes.<br><br>Adamsberg put his hand on the tank and smiled. Would Danglard have been capable of scuppering the boiler, since he was well aware that it would spread alarm and despondency? And then making sure that the technician didn&#x2019;t turn up? Yes, Danglard would have been quite capable of that. His fluid intelligence could slip into the narrowest mechanisms of the human mind. As long as the mechanisms were those of reason and logic. And it was precisely along that watershed, between reason and instinct, that Adamsberg and his deputy so diametrically differed, and had done for years.<br><br>The <i>commissaire</i> went back up the spiral staircase and crossed the large room on the ground floor where people were walking about slowly, heavy shapes bundled up in extra sweaters and scarves. Nobody knew quite why, but they called this the Council Chamber, presumably, Adamsberg thought, because of the full-scale meetings and consultations that took place there. Alongside it was the similarly named Chapter Room, where smaller gatherings were held. Where the names came from, Adamsberg did not know, but probably from Danglard, whose encyclopedic knowledge seemed to him sometimes to be unlimited, and almost toxic. The <i>capitaine</i> was capable of sudden outbursts of information, as frequent as they were uncontrollable, rather like the snorting of a horse. It could take a trifle &#x2014; an unusual word, an imperfectly formulated idea &#x2014; for him to launch into an erudite and not always well-timed lecture, which could be stopped by a warning gesture.<br><br>Shaking his head, Adamsberg communicated to the faces that looked up as he passed that the boiler was still showing no signs of life. He walked into Danglard&#x2019;s office. His deputy was finishing off various urgent reports with a gloomy air, just in case the disastrous expedition to Labrador went ahead as planned, although of course he would never reach Canada, on account of the mid-Atlantic explosion, caused by the fire in the left-hand engine, which would have been knocked out by a flock of starlings. The prospect gave him a cast-iron excuse for opening a bottle of white wine before six o&#x2019;clock. Adamsberg perched on a corner of his desk.<br><br>&#x2018;Where are we in the D&#x2019;Hernoncourt case, Danglard?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;All sewn up. The old baron has confessed. Full confession, crystal clear.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Too crystal clear by half,&#x2019; said Adamsberg, pushing the report aside and picking up the newspaper which was lying neatly folded on the desk. &#x2018;A family dinner turns into a bloodbath, and we have an old man who stumbles and stutters and can&#x2019;t express himself. Then all at once, he starts expressing himself with absolute clarity. No light and shade. No, Danglard, I&#x2019;m not signing that.&#x2019;</p><h2>A Change is Coming</h2><p>Hector Sosa Jr. was born in Puerto Rico.

Almost 18-year-old twins Georgina and Mary are the latest in a long line of Fernweh women with magical gifts ranging from teleportation to potion-making (the sisters' mother Penelope can brew a mean hangover cure). Every summer, By-the-Sea also hosts 300-year-old Annabella, an Eastern Seaborn Flicker bird who may be a Fernweh herself, and the influx of tourists who come to see her. But when Annabella is found violently murdered, suddenly the island doesn't seem so magical, and more than one dark secret must be uncovered. A magical realist YA book is still a relatively rare sight, and Leno expertly crafts this example of the genre with atmospheric prose and subtle feminism. The real heart of the novel is the exceptionally well-written female characters and relationships. Leno's way of writing Georgina's blossoming first love with island visitor Prue Lowry is so sweet and purely devoid of the "problem novel" overtones that accompany so many LGBTQ+ relationships in fiction. Her examination of the trauma of sexual assault and the "imperfect victim" is sophisticated and complex. VERDICT A necessary novel that is, at the same time, so enjoyable to read that teens will have to fight the urge to crawl into the pages.

Beginning in the thirties, both sides were well aware of the need to control not just the hearts and minds but also the resources of Latin America. The fight was often dirty: residents were captured to exchange for U.S. prisoners of war and rival spy networks shadowed each other across the continent.

A flow of raw materials in the Southern Hemisphere, at a high cost in lives, was key to ensuring Allied victory, as were military bases supporting the North African campaign, the Battle of the Atlantic and the invasion of Sicily, and fending off attacks on the Panama Canal. Allies secured loyalty through espionage and diplomacy&#x2014;including help from Hollywood and Mickey Mouse&#x2014;while Jews and innocents among ethnic groups &#x2014;Japanese, Germans&#x2014;paid an unconscionable price. Mexican pilots flew in the Philippines and twenty-five thousand Brazilians breached the Gothic Line in Italy. The Tango War also describes the machinations behind the greatest mass flight of criminals of the century, fascists with blood on their hands who escaped to the Americas.</p> <p>A true, shocking account that reads like a thriller, The Tango War shows in a new way how WWII was truly a global war.</p></p><p>Born in Chicago, MARY JO MCCONAHAY is an award-winning reporter who covered the wars in Central America and economics in the Middle East.

And his greatest creation was, of course, Flashman.

Heroes draw no higher wages than the others.&#x2019;</i> &#x2013; soldier of fortune Paolo di Avitabile in <i>Flashman</i><br><br>Just before World War I, Mark Franklin, the hero of George MacDonald Fraser&#x2019;s Mr American, travels to London, where he spends a bibulous evening with an elderly military man by the name of Sir Harry Paget Flashman. &#x2018;He had looked Sir Harry up in Who&#x2019;s Who and read incredulously through the succinct list of campaigns and decorations &#x2013; that gnarled old man sleeping there had seen Custer ride into the broken bluffs above the Little Big Horn, and fought hand to hand with Afghan tribesmen more than seventy years ago; he had ridden into the guns at Balaclava and seen the ranks form for Pickett&#x2019;s charge at Gettysburg; he had known Wellington and Lincoln . . .&#x2019;<br><br>Who wouldn&#x2019;t be incredulous? Sir Harry&#x2019;s numerous honors include not only England&#x2019;s Victoria Cross, but also the French Legion of Honour and the American Congressional Medal of Honor. His Who&#x2019;s Who entry &#x2013; should you ever happen upon it &#x2013; requires four inches of small type just to list some of his nearly unbelievable exploits. During the course of a long life, Sir Harry Paget Flashman (1822&#x2013;1915) served as a political adviser to Chancellor Bismarck on the Schleswig-Holstein question, briefly functioned as chief of staff to the Rajah of Sarawak, rode with both John Brown and Jeb Stuart, and even assisted the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico as an aide-decamp. Over the years this far-ranging traveler also spent some time as a buffalo hunter, western scout, Australian prospector, &#x2018;reluctant deputy marshal to J. B. Hickok, Esq.,&#x2019; and native interpreter &#x2013; Sir Harry spoke nine languages fluently and could &#x2018;rub along&#x2019; in another dozen or so.<br><br>Naturally, Who&#x2019;s Who &#x2013; with British discretion &#x2013; barely hints that Harry Flashman frequently spied for Her Majesty&#x2019;s government and that he was mixed up in both the African slave trade and the Underground Railroad. Moreover, through a run of astonishing bad luck, the man seems to have landed smack in the middle of virtually every major battle or civil insurrection of the nineteenth century &#x2013; the Siege of Gandamack in Afghanistan, the Zulu attack at Rorke&#x2019;s Drift, the rising of the Mahdi at Khartoum, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Peking Rebellion of 1900. During the American Civil War he even inexplicably managed to serve as a major in the Union forces and a colonel in the army of the Confederacy.<br><br>As it happens, when Mr Franklin met Sir Harry the then 92- year-old general had recently completed his personal memoirs, memoirs so disturbing that after his death they were quickly sealed and, it would appear, instantly forgotten. Indeed, the memory of Sir Harry himself gradually faded away, so that otherwise reliable histories of the Victorian era failed to assign him even a footnote. But, then, in 1965 during a sale of household furniture at Ashby in Leicestershire, the manuscript miraculously resurfaced. Ably edited by George MacDonald Fraser, the so-called Flashman Papers were eventually published in twelve volumes, each &#x2018;packet&#x2019; focusing on one or more episodes from their author&#x2019;s martial career. They begin with the teenaged Flashman&#x2019;s expulsion from Rugby School for drunkenness &#x2013; an incident mentioned in Thomas Hughes&#x2019;s almost libelous Tom Brown&#x2019;s School Days &#x2013; and follow him up to the unpleasantness, very late in his life, with Colonel Sebastian &#x2018;Tiger Jack&#x2019; Moran. That last name may be familiar, as Moran was once described by the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes as &#x2018;the second most dangerous man in London&#x2019; and &#x2018;the best heavy-game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced&#x2019;.<br><br>But, really, what impropriety in these reminiscences could have offended the sensibilities of the Flashman family? The author was the most upright of eminent Victorians, the recipient of the San Serafino Order of Purity and Truth, the honorary president of the Mission for the Reclamation of Reduced Females, and the former governor of his alma mater, that bastion of muscular Christianity, Rugby School. Perhaps Sir Harry&#x2019;s family, in particular his clerical son, the Reverend<br>Bishop Harry Albert Victor Flashman, simply felt it wiser for posterity to honor a public career already well documented in Dawns and Departures of a Soldier&#x2019;s Life and &#x2019;Twixt Cossack and Cannon. Yet time has not been kind to these stiffly official memoirs. They are as forgotten now as if they had never existed, while great scholars and common readers alike return regularly to the Flashman Papers for instruction and delight. And, it goes without saying, for the irresistible brazen effrontery of the man himself. For in these memoirs, Sir Harry Flashman, the supposed Victorian equivalent of a &#x2018;parfit gentil knyght,&#x2019; reveals himself to be &#x2013; in his own words &#x2013; &#x2018;a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward &#x2013; and, oh yes, a toady.&#x2019;<br><br>In fact, Flashman is one of the world&#x2019;s most entertaining and beguiling rogues. He pursues life&#x2019;s pleasures with Casanovian gusto, regularly employs the colorful language of the barracks, and knows that &#x2018;there isn&#x2019;t any folly a man won&#x2019;t contemplate if there&#x2019;s money or a woman at stake.&#x2019; With his gallant sidewhiskers, bold dark eyes with hooded lids, and strong, aquiline nose, this charming dastard &#x2013; fourteen stone of sheer manliness &#x2013; regularly seduces schoolgirls and queens, hides or runs away when fights break out, and manages, through deception and utter poltroonery, to survive when better men die. As he says (in Royal Flash): &#x2018;The ideal time to be a hero is when the battle is over and the other fellows are dead, God rest &#x2019;em, and you take the credit.&#x2019;<br><br>The three startling, even shocking adventures reprinted in this Everyman omnibus provide the ideal introduction to Sir Harry&#x2019;s rumbustious life. In Flashman the youthful anti-hero spends his last day at Rugby, enlists in the army, captures the heart (and body) of the fair-haired Elspeth, and reluctantly embarks on a mission to mountainous, war-torn Afghanistan. In Flash for Freedom! the luckless Flashy joins the crew of an African slave ship, unwillingly assists the Underground Railroad, and fortuitously meets a rising young American politician named Abraham Lincoln. (In later years, Lincoln was known to say: &#x2018;When all other trusts fail, turn to Flashman.&#x2019; I believe that the word &#x2018;all&#x2019; should be emphasized.) Finally, Flashman in the Great Game takes our man into the world of Kim, as he spies for the British, dallies with a luscious maharani, and desperately struggles to survive the blood-baths of the Sepoy Mutiny.<br><br>That he does so will hardly come as a surprise, nor that he emerges from his Indian nightmare not only alive but also elevated to a knighthood. Nevertheless, a few crudely unimaginative critics have suggested that nobody could actually have escaped from so many deadly ambushes and battles. Two or three have even gone so far as to speculate that George Mac-DonaldFraser is&nbsp; the&nbsp; author, not the editor, of the Flashman Papers, with the deeply cynical implication that Flashman himself is merely a character in a series of clever novels. Sigh. What can you expect these days from cloistered academics, none of whom is even half as alive as Flashman? Flashy may not be as admirable as, say, Don Quixote, Lord Greystoke or Sherlock Holmes, but he&#x2019;s certainly just as real.</p><h2>Almanac of American Politics 2020</h2><p><p>The 2020 Almanac of American Politics remains the gold standard of accessible political information, relied on by everyone involved, invested or interested in politics in America.

Amy died a torturous death as cancer ate her alive; his uncle was dead along with the job he loved at West Point. And now, so was Peggy. He was wanted for murder in the country he&#x2019;d fought for so many times and he had a legion of enemies trying to track him down for the things he knew and the power he had. Power that he didn&#x2019;t want, power that he&#x2019;d never asked for, power that he wished desperately he had never known existed.</p><p>He stood on the high cliffs of the Dorset coast feeling the cold, slanting rain from the English Channel slashing into him, chilling him to the bone. On a clear day, you could make out the coast of France from the muddy pathway, but it hadn&#x2019;t been clear for weeks now.</p><p>Lieutenant Colonel John &#x201c;Doc&#x201d; Holliday, U.S. Army Rangers (retired), turned away from the cliffs and followed the path back up to the old thatched cottage that he and Eddie Cabrera had rented for the winter, paying six months in advance and in cash. He and Eddie were living completely off the grid now&#x2014;no credit cards, no cell phones, no wireless devices of any kind. The only communication they had with the outside world was a big Grundig Satellit 900 portable radio with short wave, long wave and police bands.</p><p>Holliday turned up the walk and stepped through the little gate and into the overgrown garden in front of the cottage. The old woman who owned the place was willing to have the dead plants and dry grasses cleared away, but Holliday had declined the offer. The tall grass and the windswept undergrowth gave the place a deserted look, which was just what he wanted. The cottage was located on a low hill and there wasn&#x2019;t a neighbor for a mile in any direction. The closest village was Pelham Buckthorpe, a three-mile walk inland, or twenty minutes away on the bicycle that served as their only means of transportation. The nearest constabulary was in Swanage, twenty miles up the coast. &#x201c;Isolation&#x201d; was a word he and Eddie were taking quite seriously these days.</p><p>Holliday tapped his boots on the fieldstone step and gave a triple tap twice on the worn plank door, announcing his arrival. He pressed down the latch and stepped into the cottage.</p><p>Eddie was sitting in one of the old overstuffed armchairs in the living room with an old Purdey Nitro Express elephant gun resting across his legs. The radio stood on the Victorian end table beside him, chattering quietly.</p><p>&#x201c;Anything?&#x201d; Holliday asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Very quiet, mi amigo,&#x201d; replied his Cuban friend. From the kitchen Holliday could smell the rich aroma of some kind of stew. Thankfully the Cuban loved to cook and was good at it; Holliday&#x2019;s repertoire of culinary expertise ran to overcooked fried eggs, charred burgers and barely edible mac and cheese from the box.</p><p>Holliday waited until they had sat down for the evening meal to lay out his thoughts. &#x201c;I was thinking today while I was out for my walk,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Only poets and sailors&#x2019; wives should think while walking by the sea.&#x201d; Eddie smiled, mopping up the last of his stew with a chunk of bread.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re right, but I&#x2019;ve still been thinking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About what, compadre?&#x201d; asked the tall black Cuban, his intelligent brown eyes searching Holliday&#x2019;s expression.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking it&#x2019;s time we parted ways,&#x201d; said Holliday.</p><p>Eddie sat back in his chair. &#x201c;And why would that be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s me they&#x2019;re after, not you. I&#x2019;m the one they want to kill. I&#x2019;m the one with the notebook and all the secrets. I have no right to drag you into all this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nobody drags Eddie Vladimir Cabrera Alphonso anywhere he does not want to go. Anything I have done, I have done willingly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all well and good but I don&#x2019;t think you should share in a burden you never chose.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one chooses their burdens, Doc. Fate throws them in our direction and we either avoid them or we do not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One of these days they&#x2019;re going to find me and eventually they&#x2019;re going to kill me. There&#x2019;s no reason you should die too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are friends, Doc, and friends do not abandon each other just because life becomes difficult.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I still think we should split up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what do I do with myself? There is very little call for river pilots these days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re making this difficult,&#x201d; said Holliday.</p><p>&#x201c;And I intend to keep on making it difficult with every sentence you speak, amigo, so why not shut up and help me with the dishes?&#x201d;</p><p>Someone knocked at the door.</p><p>Holliday and Eddie both stood up. Eddie picked up the shotgun leaning on the table at his side and both men moved silently toward the door, keeping out of a direct line of fire. Holliday reached the door and stood with his back against the wall. Eddie lowered himself behind one of the upholstered chairs, aiming the elephant rifle over the back and directly toward the door at latch level. Anyone coming through unannounced would be cut into ribbons.</p><p>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; Holliday called out.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Carrie Pilkington, Colonel Holliday. We spent some time together in Cuba a while back. There&#x2019;s an MI5 kill team fifteen minutes out. We don&#x2019;t have much time.&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie cocked the huge-bore rifle. Holliday thumbed down the latch and threw open the door. A pretty woman with dark hair pulled into a ponytail stood there, dressed in climbing gear with a long skein of nylon rope over one shoulder and a gym bag over the other. Her black vest was hung with pitons, clips and locking rings. She was also wearing a 9-millimeter Glock 19 in a sling holster. &#x201c;Let me in,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m dripping wet.&#x201d;</p><p>Holliday stood aside and she stepped into the cottage. Holliday closed the door behind her and the young woman dropped the gym bag onto the floor.</p><p>&#x201c;How do you know that MI5 is coming with a kill team?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I still have connections,&#x201d; said the young woman.</p><p>Holliday remembered. &#x201c;Black, the Englishman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; She nodded. &#x201c;But we can reminisce later. We&#x2019;ve got about ten minutes before they start throwing flash-bangs through the window.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where do we go?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The cliffs. Put on something waterproof and come with me. Colonel, bring that bag. Forget everything else.&#x201d;</p><p>A hundred feet down the path, with the cottage lights blazing behind them, they reached the cliff edge. The rain was coming down in windy sheets from the sea and Holliday could barely hear the waves crashing in on the rocky beach a hundred feet below them. There were already two heavy pitons holding lengths of rope pegged into the chalky soil when Carrie Pilkington opened the bag and pulled out two climbing harnesses.</p><p>&#x201c;Either of you do any rappelling?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; answered Holliday.</p><p>Eddie shook his head.</p><p>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re quick studies. Get into the harnesses,&#x201d; she said sharply. From somewhere behind them there was the harsh coughing sound of a rifle-fired grenade launcher.</p><p>By the time the two men figured out the trusslike harnesses and fit them around their legs and thighs, Carrie had set the third line. She slipped a self-locking carabiner at their waists through each of the lines and guided them to the edge of the cliff, standing away from the sea.</p><p>&#x201c;Go down backward and ease yourself over the edge and walk down the cliff until you feel comfortable. Then do small jumps outward while letting the line slip through your hands, but keep the loop around your elbow. Ten or fifteen jumps should get you to the bottom.&#x201d;</p><p>There was the sound of automatic fire coming from the cottage now. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re playing our tune, guys. Time to bug out. Don&#x2019;t look down, as the saying goes.&#x201d; She pushed Holliday lightly on the chest and he went over into the rain-filled darkness.</p><p>The girl was right. His feet hit the beach with a crunching clatter after less than a minute and a half of unholy terror as he gave himself over to the thin nylon rope and the steel clip on the heavy belt around his waist. Before he had time to slip out of the harness, Eddie and Carrie had both reached the beach.</p><p>&#x201c;Santa Madre de Mierda Cristo!&#x201d; Eddie exclaimed, breathing hard.</p><p>&#x201c;What now?&#x201d; Holliday asked.</p><p>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; said the girl, pointing down the beach. A four-man Zodiac with a fifty-horsepower Evinrude had been pulled up onto the stony beach, the engine tilted up on the transom. They ran down the beach and Carrie hopped in first, heading for the bow. Eddie and Holliday pushed the inflatable into the water and jumped into the stern. Eddie lowered the engine and hit the electric start. Carrie took a small GPS unit out of her vest. &#x201c;That way!&#x201d; Carrie yelled, her hand pointing just left of center. &#x201c;Full bore! They&#x2019;ll have us in a minute or two.&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie twisted the throttle and they blindly moved out into the choppy water. The flare went up less than thirty seconds later.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; said Carrie from the bow, looking up from the GPS unit. She watched as the flare burned brightly overhead and began to flutter down on its parachute. They were outlined as though they had been caught in the eye of a searchlight, the light twitching and casting shadows as the flare skirled downward erratically. Finally it fizzled out and darkness shrouded their position.</p><p>&#x201c;Kill the engine!&#x201d; she ordered sharply. Eddie didn&#x2019;t ask any questions, just followed orders. &#x201c;Holliday! Get down there and help your friend. We&#x2019;ve got to tip the engine overboard&#x2014;fast!&#x201d;</p><p>Holliday knew exactly why and it raised the hairs on the back of his neck. Eddie had the first of the big cleats loosened and Holliday helped him with the other one. There was a sharp echoing crack-bang of a Stinger or its British equivalent as they pushed the outboard into the sea. Another flare went up, this one fired at an angle away from the bow of the boat. A split second later there was a brilliant explosion three hundred yards to port as the infrared heat-seeking surface-to-air missile impacted with the closest source of heat&#x2014;the flare rather than the Evinrude, which now lay at the bottom of the sea. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re pretty good at this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get excited&#x2014;we&#x2019;re not out of the woods yet. There&#x2019;s two oars clipped to the gunnels. Set them up and row like hell. They&#x2019;ll figure things out quickly enough.&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie and Holliday pulled together, their backs to Carrie and facing the cliffs, which were now no more than shadows through the rain. There was another detonation from the one-man SAM at the summit of the cliffs, but, hearing it, Carrie fired another flare, this one high and to port side again. The infrared tracker in the missile took to the white-hot flare and there was a second explosion with a shock wave that slammed hard enough to hurt their eardrums. A few seconds later Holliday felt the inflatable bump into something.</p><p>&#x201c;We have arrived, folks,&#x201d; said Carrie.</p><p>Holliday looked to his right. Rising out of the water was the gray-blue hull of a boat. From what he could see, it was about sixty feet long. &#x201c;What the hell is this and where did you get it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a refurbished World War II motor torpedo boat. A Vosper,&#x201d; Carrie said. She gripped the rope and plastic ladder hanging over the gunnels. &#x201c;I got it because I know people who like to smuggle cigarettes and other things across the Channel. Now climb aboard and let&#x2019;s get the hell out of here.&#x201d;<br><br><b>2</b></p><p>There are five main bodies that make up the Channel Islands, an archipelago located off the coast of Normandy&#x2014;the last remaining &#x201c;bailiwicks&#x201d; of the Duchy of Normandy. The islands are British protectorates, but are not governed by the United Kingdom or the European Union. Even so, since the citizens of the islands have full UK status, they are also holders of all the privileges of the European Union.</p><p>The five islands are Jersey, Guernsey, Herm, Alderney and Sark, with Sark being slightly different from its neighbors since it is ruled by the hereditary Seigneur of Sark. The Channel Islands are an interesting and sometimes confusing place to live. They&#x2019;re also very useful for people hiding money or themselves from various and sundry government agencies since they take both their privacy and their independence very seriously.</p><p>Herm is the smallest of the islands. The northern end is craggy and mostly full of cliffs while the southern end is all sandy beaches. Cars are not allowed on the island, nor are bicycles. Quad bikes and tractors are allowed for the locals. Its main source of income is tourism, but there is some farming, animal raising and fishing. There are no customs agents except at the ferry terminal and no local police at all.</p><p>Carrie Pilkington guided the Vosper into a small cove on the west side of the island and then led them along the beach to a small fisherman&#x2019;s cottage that had been built on a low rise above the beach. The dawn was just beginning to light the sea behind them and the fog was so thick it was unlikely that anyone saw them arrive.</p><p>The cottage was a plain two-story affair with a living/dining area, a kitchen and a bathroom on the ground floor, and a narrow staircase leading up to a pair of small rooms. The roof was slate, the floors were wide planked and the small windows were covered with faded yellow curtains. It had that lonely feeling of a house that hasn&#x2019;t been lived in for a very long time.</p><p>Carrie went to the kitchen larder, brought out cutlery, a loaf of sourdough bread, a brick of cheese, a pot of mustard, some butter and the remains of a ham. &#x201c;Dig in&#x2014;we won&#x2019;t be here long,&#x201d; she said, sitting down. She began slicing up the bread.</p><p>&#x201c;Where exactly are we going?&#x201d; Holliday asked, building himself a sandwich. He was starving and realized that he hadn&#x2019;t eaten since the previous afternoon.</p><p>&#x201c;First Guernsey on the ferry and then to France by air.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Without papers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Leave that to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Last time I checked you were a CIA analyst working out of Langley. What the hell are you doing out in the field?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As far as the Company knows I never made it out of Cuba alive, if you remember that little drama.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Vividly,&#x201d; said Holliday. He and Eddie had gone looking for Eddie&#x2019;s vanished brother and found themselves in the middle of an invasion.</p><p>&#x201c;I was recruited by another group, and I&#x2019;ve been working for them for the last two years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What group?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Officially, it&#x2019;s the Joint International Office of Intelligence Oversight, but it&#x2019;s generally called JOI, when it&#x2019;s called anything at all. In-house, it&#x2019;s just called the Office,&#x201d; she responded.</p><p>&#x201c;Another acronym.&#x201d; Holliday sighed. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this one supposed to do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just what it says. The big intelligence agencies around the world have become their own governments&#x2014;they do what they want to, and get what they want. They&#x2019;re out of control. We&#x2019;re supposed to rein them in, or at the very least gather intelligence about what they&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So just who is the Office made up of and why is it interested in me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Office is a joint committee of high-ranking government and military ...</p></p><h2>Yellow Negroes and Other Imaginary Creatures</h2><p><i><b><b>One of the </b></b></i><b><b>Globe &amp; Mail&#x2019;</b></b><i><b><b>s 100 Best Books of 2018</b></b></i><br><b><br></b><br><b>A timely collection of work about race and immigration in Paris by one of France's most revered cult comic book artists.</b><br>Yvan Alagb� is one of the most innovative and provocative artists in the world of comics.

The series first appeared in French in Le Petit Vingtieme, a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle on 10 January 1929. Set in a painstakingly researched world closely mirroring our own, Herge's Tintin series continues to be a favorite of readers and critics alike 80 years later.<br>The hero of the series is Tintin, a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures from the beginning by his faithful fox terrier dog Snowy (Milou in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash, cynical and grumpy Captain Haddock, the bright but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (Professeur Tournesol) and other colorful supporting characters such as the incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (Dupond et Dupont). Herge himself features in several of the comics as a background character; as do his assistants in some instances.<br>The success of the series saw the serialized strips collected into a series of albums (24 in all), spun into a successful magazine and adapted for film and theatre. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in over 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date. <br>The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herge's signature ligne claire style. Engaging, well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humor, accompanied in later albums by sophisticated satire, and political and cultural commentary.</p><p>Herge, one of the most famous Belgians in the world, was a comics writer and artist. The internationally successful Adventures of Tintin are his most well-known and beloved works. They have been translated into 38 different languages and have inspired such legends as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. He wrote and illustrated for The Adventures of Tintin until his death in 1983.Text: French</p><h2>Better Off Thread (Embroidery Mystery)</h2><p><b>Santa finds himself in a stitch of trouble in the tenth in the series from the national bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Stitching Hour</i>...</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Marcy is busy helping her customers make hand-crafted ornaments at her embroidery shop, the Seven-Year Stitch.

My gray Irish wolfhound, Angus, flopped onto the floor beside me and heaved a sigh.<br><br>"What a day, huh, Angus?" I looked over at our mannequin, Jill-who normally resembles Marilyn Monroe-and noticed that her wig was now sideways and covering her entire face. I laughed. "I think Jill has had an even rougher day than we have."<br><br>Black Friday. Although the other merchants in Tallulah Falls and I couldn't offer the deep discounts provided by the large chain stores, we'd all done something to try to sway customers to shop with us today. My friends Blake and Sadie MacKenzie of MacKenzies' Mochas had offered customers free coffee with the purchase of a pastry. Todd Calloway of the Brew Crew had forgone giving out free beer and had instead provided shoppers with bottles of water and a place to leave their bags so they wouldn't have too much to carry as they wandered from shop to shop.<br><br>I'd brought in a toaster oven this morning and had provided patrons with freshly baked cookies and a twenty-five percent discount off their total purchases. I'd expected an upsurge in traffic, but I hadn't been prepared for the amount of business I'd received today. I'd been open last year on Black Friday, but the Seven-Year Stitch had been in business but a few weeks then, and although business had been good, I don't think people were as aware of the shop as they were now. Plus, I was getting better at the promotional side of things. I'd been closed for the past few days, but for two weeks prior to that, I'd been putting flyers in everyone's bags advertising the Thanksgiving celebration.<br><br>I pushed myself off the sofa and went over to adjust Jill's wig. I smoothed it down and then straightened her apron. I typically dressed Jill to coincide with the season. With the Thanksgiving holiday upon us, I'd dressed her in a 1950s-style A-line dress-complete with crinoline-and a ruffled apron. She looked darling . . . or, well, she did after I fixed her wig.<br><br>I looked around the rest of the shop. Beyond Jill and the checkout counter to the left were bins of floss and yarn. Maple racks containing pattern books, needles, hoops, crochet hooks, and other needlecraft supplies filled the rest of the left side of the shop. To the right of the counter was the sit-and-stitch square. Two navy sofas faced each other and were separated by an oval maple coffee table atop a red-and-blue braided rug. Red club chairs and matching ottomans rounded out the seating area, where patrons were invited to-you guessed it-sit and stitch.<br><br>On the walls and atop the maple racks were embroidery projects I'd completed, as well as dolls whose outfits I'd made or embellished with embroidery. Candlewicked pillows usually adorned the sofas in the sit-and-stitch square, but I'd placed them in the office today. I'd been afraid that children with chocolaty fingers and faces would latch onto the white pillows. That was something I hadn't originally considered when I'd decided to offer cookies to the Stitch patrons.<br><br>Deciding that putting the pillows back in place was the next-easiest thing to do-after making Jill presentable again-I retrieved the pillows, fluffed them, and placed them on the sofa. With my hands on my hips, I surveyed the rest of the shop. I needed to straighten the floss bins, restock the yarn, vacuum, dust the shelves, clean the glass. . . . But I was so tired.<br><br>"We'll get here early and tidy up in the morning, Angus," I said. "Let's go home, buddy."<br><br>He leapt to his feet, apparently as delighted by the prospect of going home as I was.<br><br>When we got to our white, two-story home and saw Ted's car in the driveway, my heart lifted even more. I'm pretty sure Angus felt the same way. Ted was the most wonderful man in the whole wide world, and he was mine. Well, Angus would say he was ours.<br><br>Ted opened the door as Angus and I got to the porch. He was wearing a black apron emblazoned with Kiss the Cook. Being a stickler for following rules, I did as instructed . . . several times, in fact.<br><br>The house smelled wonderful. I closed my eyes and took in the blend of scents: oregano, beef, sausage, basil, tomato sauce, garlic.<br><br>"Did you make lasagna?" I asked.<br><br>He smiled. "I did. I'm tired of turkey, and I guessed you and Angus are, too."<br><br>"You're absolutely right."<br><br>We'd had a whirlwind week. Last Saturday after work, I'd closed up the Stitch and Ted, Angus, and I had flown to San Francisco. Mom had insisted on our bringing Angus, and she'd even made the necessary travel arrangements. I was glad. I hadn't wanted to spend four days away from him.<br><br>Ted and I had stayed with Mom. On Sunday, she'd had a delicious Thanksgiving meal catered for us. Alfred Benton, Mom's longtime lawyer and recent boyfriend, joined us. He always joined us for holiday celebrations-he'd been a surrogate dad to me ever since my own father had died when I was a toddler-but this time it was more special. It was apparent that he and Mom were in love. And since I'd left San Francisco last year to open my shop in Tallulah Falls, it was great to see her with someone-especially someone she loved and who obviously made her feel so loved. I just couldn't figure out what had taken them so long.<br><br>We'd flown back from San Fran on Wednesday morning, and we'd had dinner with Ted's mom yesterday. I'd been nervous about spending Thanksgiving Day with Ted's family. Not only was his mom there, but his sister and her family were there as well. Tiffany was married and had a two-year-old son.<br><br>Ted's sister was two years younger than he. Like Ted and his mother, she had those striking blue eyes. But there the resemblance ended. I imagined Tiffany must've taken after her father. She had chestnut brown hair with honey highlights, and she was only about three inches taller than me. Ted was around six-feet-one or two, and I was five-foot-nothing if I stretched out my spine and held my head high. And Ted's hair was black with flecks of premature gray.<br><br>I ran my hands through his hair as I stood there looking up at him. "I'm so glad to finally have you to myself. Not that I haven't enjoyed spending time with Mom and Alfred and your mom and meeting Tiffany and her family, it's just . . ."<br><br>"I know, Marcy." He lowered his mouth to mine. "I've missed being alone with you, too."<br><br>After dinner, we went into my all-white living room. Some people probably thought I was crazy for having a white sofa and chair and a huge, wiry gray dog that shed pretty regularly. But I found the color peaceful, and regular vacuuming and lint brushing took care of any wayward hair.<br><br>After dinner, Angus went out to the backyard to play. Ted and I cuddled up on the large overstuffed sofa. He kissed the top of my head.<br><br>"Thank you for making dinner," I said.<br><br>"You're welcome. I knew you'd be exhausted when you got here. How'd the cookies go over?"<br><br>"Really well. People were delighted with them."<br><br>"I was half-afraid you'd get busy and burn a batch and the whole shop would smell like smoke for a week."<br><br>I gaped at him. "Gee, thanks!"<br><br>He chuckled. "I didn't mean it that way. I just thought about you being there by yourself, trying to manage all the customers and bake cookies at the same time. Since I had to work only half a day, I started to come by. But I figured you probably had things under control and that you'd rather have dinner waiting for you than a guy who knows very little about embroidery helping out at the Stitch."<br><br>I smiled. "Well, you were right." I snuggled against him, wrapping one arm around his waist. "Although I wouldn't have minded your stopping by."<br><br>"I know. How did you manage, anyway?"<br><br>"I had most of the cookies baked by the time people started coming in. Then as I started to run out, I'd put in a batch, set the timer, and then run to get them when the timer went off," I said. "People were good about my having to stop now and then to get the cookies. They understood that I was the only person working. Well, that is, except for one dotty little lady who thought Jill was rude for not helping out."<br><br>"Well, Jill is a fairly realistic-looking mannequin."<br><br>"Ha! You should've seen her by the end of the day when her wig was on crooked!"<br><br>We were laughing about that when the doorbell rang.<br><br>I froze. "Did you invite anyone over?"<br><br>"Not me."<br><br>"We could pretend we aren't here." I was sitting up even as I spoke.<br><br>"With both our cars in the driveway? Not likely." Ted stood. "I'll go to the door. Maybe it's just an early caroler or something."<br><br>"It's still November."<br><br>"And Christmas merchandise has been in the store since September," he pointed out.<br><br>Ted went to the door. When I heard Captain Moe's voice, I joined them in the foyer. Captain Moe was a large, beefy man with white hair and a full white beard. I often compared him in my mind to Alan Hale, who'd played the Skipper on the classic television show Gilligan's Island.<br><br>Captain Moe swept me off my feet in a hug. "I'm sorry to barge in on you fine folks."<br><br>"You're always welcome," I said. "Would you like something to drink? Are you hungry?"<br><br>"No, Tinkerbell. After the past few days, I shouldn't need anything to eat or drink for a week." Captain Moe had called me Tinkerbell since the first time we'd met. I didn't know if that was due to my size or my hair color, but, either way, I took it as the endearment that Captain Moe intended it to be.<br><br>"Come on into the living room," Ted said.<br><br>He and I sat on the sofa, and Captain Moe filled the matching armchair across from us.<br><br>"I'm here with my proverbial hat in my hands," said the captain.<br><br>"What's wrong?" Ted asked.<br><br>"You know we'll do whatever we can to help you," I said.<br><br>Captain Moe held up an index finger. "You'd best hear me out before you say that, Tink. You see, I agreed to play Santa Claus for the Tallulah County General Hospital. I was there today, and I'll be there tomorrow evening and Sunday evening."<br><br>"That's wonderful." I smiled. Captain Moe would be the perfect Santa. He already looked the part, and he certainly had the heart of the jolly old elf.<br><br>"It is nice," he said. "I'm meeting primarily with children, but I'll also be seeing a few of the elderly patients and anyone else who'd like to join in the fun."<br><br>"I'm surprised the hospital is having you come in so early," Ted said.<br><br>"I was, too. But the administrator explained to me that it's difficult for these patients and their loved ones not to be able to have their traditional Thanksgiving Day meals and visits with extended family members, and she hopes having me there will brighten their weekend. I'm to go back the weekend before Christmas and on Christmas Eve."<br><br>"It's awfully thoughtful of you to volunteer so much of your time," I told him.<br><br>He winced slightly when I said that.<br><br>"What?" I asked.<br><br>"I have absolutely no right to ask you, and you can most certainly say no and I will understand completely, but you're the first person who came to mind," he babbled.<br><br>Captain Moe was not a babbler. This was really important to him. "Please, just ask whatever it is you want to ask."<br><br>"I need an elf," he said.<br><br>Ted covered his mouth with his hand and his shoulders started to shake.<br><br>"Um, excuse me?" I asked.<br><br>"You see, I had an elf. The hospital had one lined up. She was there half the day today, and she was a tremendous help. In fact, I didn't realize how helpful she was until she'd left."<br><br>"She left?" I asked. "You mean, she quit?"<br><br>"Well, she didn't simply up and quit. Her babysitter called, and one of her children has a stomach bug," he said. "She won't be coming back tomorrow."<br><br>"And you'd like me to take her place?" Me? An elf? Okay, I could understand why Captain Moe would think of me for the job: I'm short. But the Stitch was open tomorrow. And I didn't have anyone lined up to run the shop in my absence. On the other hand, this was Captain Moe. How many times had he been there for me?<br><br>He seemed to have read my mind. "I know you have to work, but we don't have to be there tomorrow evening until six o'clock. You can even bring Angus. We can put some antlers on him and he can be our reindeer."<br><br>Ted laughed out loud at that. "That's fantastic!"<br><br>"Isn't it, though?" Captain Moe agreed. "The children would adore him."<br><br>"But I don't have a costume," I said.<br><br>"The hospital will provide one for you. We just need to let them know your size."<br><br>"What would I have to do?"<br><br>"You pretty much keep the children corralled and happy until it's their turn to talk with me. Hand out coloring books and peppermint sticks-that sort of thing." He held up his hands. "Again, don't feel obligated. If you can do it, I'd greatly appreciate it. But if you can't, I'll try to find someone else."<br><br>"And this is just for tomorrow night?" I asked.<br><br>"And Sunday," he said. "If you can."<br><br>"I can." I smiled a little uncertainly. "You can count on Angus and me."<br><br>"Thank you so much. You don't know how much I appreciate this."<br><br>After Captain Moe had left and we'd nestled back onto the sofa, Ted turned to me with a mischievous grin. "He doesn't know how much I appreciate this! I can hardly wait to see you in your elf costume."<br><br>"Ted . . ."<br><br>"He said it was for anyone who wanted to join in the fun. I want to join in the fun."<br><br>I whacked him with a throw pillow.<br><br>"You know what we should do? We should watch some Christmas movies so you can pick up some pointers."<br><br>I hit him again. He was laughing so hard, I don't even think he noticed.</p><h2>Benching Jim Crow: The Rise and Fall of the Color Line in Southern College Sports, 1890-1980 (Sport and Society)</h2><p>Chronicling the uneven rise and slow decline of segregation in American college athletics, Charles H. Martin shows how southern colleges imposed their policies of racial exclusion on surprisingly compliant northern teams and explains the social forces that eventually forced these southern schools to accept integrated competition. Martin emphasizes not just the racism prevalent in football and basketball in the South, but the effects of this discrimination for colleges and universities all over the country. Southern teams such as the University of Alabama, University of Mississippi, and the University of North Carolina were obsessed with national recognition, but their Jim Crow policies prevented them for many years from playing against racially mixed teams from other parts of the country.&nbsp;Devoting special attention to the Southeastern Conference, the Atlantic Coast Conference, and teams in Texas, Martin explores the changing social attitudes and culture of competition that turned the tide and allowed for the recruitment of black players and hiring of black coaches. He takes a close look at the case of Texas Western College (now the University of Texas at El Paso), the first major white university in an ex-Confederate state to recruit African American athletes extensively. Martin skillfully weaves existing arguments and documentation on the integration of college sports with wide-ranging, original research, including previously unpublished papers and correspondence of college administrators and athletic directors uncovered in university archives.</p><p>A benchmark study of racial exclusion in college athletics<b>Charles H.

Michael Billington in &#34;The Guardian&#34; described the play succinctly: &#34;The new Radical Liberal Party has made the ex-Minister of Agriculture Archbishop of Cantebury, British astronauts are scrapping with each other on the moon, and spritely academics steal about London by night indulging in murderous gymnastics: this is the kind of manic, futuristic, topsy-turvy world in which Stoppard&#39;s dazzling new play is set. And if I add that the influences apparently include Wittgenstein, Magritte, the Goons, Robert Dhery, Joe Orton, and The Avengers, you will have some idea of the heady brew Stoppard has here concocted.&#34; The protagonist incude an aging Professor Of Moral Philosophy -- trying to compose a lecture on &#34;Man -- Good, Bad or Indifferent&#34; -- while ignoring a corpse in the next room; his beautiful young wife, an ex-musical comedy Queen, lasciviously entertaining his university boss down the hall; her husband&#39;s specially trained hare, Thumpers; and a chorus of gymnasts, Jumpers.</p><p>Tom Stoppard is the author of such seminal works as Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead, Travesties, Every Good Boy Deserves a Favor, Arcadia, Jumpers, The Real Thing, and The Invention of Love.</p><h2>The Burning of the White House: James and Dolley Madison and the War of 1812</h2><p>It's unimaginable today, even for a generation that saw the Twin Towers fall and the Pentagon attacked. It's unimaginable because in 1814 enemies didn't fly overhead, they marched through the streets; and for 26 hours in August, the British enemy marched through Washington, D.C. and set fire to government buildings, including the U.S. Capitol and the White House.<br> <br>Relying on first-hand accounts, historian Jane Hampton Cook weaves together several different narratives to create a vivid, multidimensional account of the burning of Washington, including the escalation that led to it and the immediate aftermath. From James and Dolley Madison to the British admiral who ordered the White House set aflame, historical figures are brought to life through their experience of this unprecedented attack. <i>The Burning of the White House</i> is the story of a city invaded, a presidential family displaced, a nation humbled, and an American spirit that somehow remained unbroken.</p><p><b>The White House in Flames</b> <p></p>In 1814, Washington was set alight by the invading British, in an outrage unequaled until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. <p></p>How did it happen?

And how did his socialite wife, Dolley Madison, respond to the invasion of the redcoats? <p></p>Here, in <i>The Burning of the White House</i>, award-winning author Jane Hampton Cook brings this exciting story to life--from the intrigue of disloyal cabinet members, to the pacifist Quaker faith of the lively and defiant Dolley Madison, to adventures involving future president James Monroe, amateur poet Francis Scott Key, and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow author Washington Irving. <p></p> <i>The Burning of the White House</i> gives you a front row seat at one of the most dramatic, contentious, and dangerous times in American history, with New England threatening secession (fifty years before the South seceded, precipitating the Civil War), British Rear Admiral George Cockburn plotting his attack on the newly independent nation's young capital, and President Madison's opponents criticizing him for being weak and ineffectual before Madison, in the end, emerged victorious. <p></p>Colorful, informative, and a tremendous read, <i>The Burning of the White House </i>is a riveting account of the first great war in America's post-independence history, sure to merit a place on any history lover's bookshelf.<br>JANE HAMPTON COOK is an award-winning author who brings history and biographies to life.

After the horrors of the war, Victor and Eva&#x2019;s return to their Dresden home seems like a fairytale. Victor tries to resume his distinguished academic career and joins East Germany&#x2019;s Communist Party. In 1951, Eva dies; a year later, aged 70, Victor marries a student an unlikely but successful love match. But with the growing repression of the Communist Party, and the memory of those who did not survive, Victor&#x2019;s achievements ring hollow. Politics, he comes to believe, is, above all, the choice of the lesser evil.&#x201d; A masterpiece both of Holocaust literature and memoir.</p><p>Born in 1881, Victor Klemperer studied in Munich, Geneva and Paris. He served in the German Army in the First World War and was decorated. He was a professor in Dresden until he was dismissed as a result of Nazi laws in 1935. He survived the Holocaust and the war, and taught again as an academic until his death in 1960. Martin Chalmers, the translator of the first two volumes, has also translated this volume.This third and final volume of the diaries of Klemperer, a German-Jewish professor of philology who survived the Nazis because his wife was Christian, lacks the inherent drama of his life under the Nazis, related in the first two, highly acclaimed volumes, and many readers will be mystified by the political twists and turns of East German communism. Nonetheless, Klemperer was an acute observer of life's complexities, and the diary becomes quite a good read. In 1945, he is amazed that he has survived, but the conditions of life are still wrenching. He is suspicious of all the former acquaintances who shunned him in the Nazi years and now fawn over him. As a privileged academic in Communist East Germany, Klemperer attends endless, mind-numbing meetings, but also receives a number of appointments, a good salary and a cherished automobile. He publishes his most important work,<i> LTI,</i> a study of Nazi language. As someone who had suffered so acutely under the Nazis, he believes communism is "the lesser evil," yet he is anguished by the parallels between Nazism and communism. The diary is a poignant document about life under communism and the political choices that so many Europeans faced after WWII. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Randolph Aldridge is the mill&#x2019;s manager, sent by his father&#x2014;the mill owner&#x2014;to reform both the damaged mill and his damaged older brother. Byron Aldridge is the mill's lawman, a shell-shocked World War I veteran given to stunned silences and sudden explosions of violence that make him a mystery to Randolph and a danger to himself. Deep in the swamp, in this place of water moccasins, whiskey, and wild card games, these brothers become embroiled in a lethal feud with a powerful gangster. In a tale full of raw emotion as supple as a saw blade,<i> </i><b>The Clearing</b> is a mesmerizing journey into the trials that define men&#x2019;s souls.</p><p>In Tim Gautreaux's first novel, <i>The Next Step in the Dance</i>, the author staked a literary claim to Louisiana bayou country. In his second novel, <i>The Clearing</i>, he colonizes that claim. The atmosphere of the novel is humid and snake-infested, a swamp alive with mosquitoes and hungry alligators, stinkbugs and stench, flooding and freezing alternately. The setting provides a fitting backdrop for the bare subsistence lives of the people who live there.<p> The time is 1923, the place a family-owned mill, and the people a motley collection made up of a manager from Pennsylvania, his brother the constable, poor white and black loggers, three women, Sicilians, and polyglot Cajuns. Byron, the constable, a golden boy before the war, eldest son and heir apparent to a timber fortune, returned from France a damaged man, no longer interested in family or future. He drifted away from home and lost contact. When the novel begins, he has been found in this Louisiana backwater and his brother, Randolph, is dispatched to manage the family mill until the cypress forest is cleared and to bring Byron home. What happens to them in this hermetically sealed redoubt is a story of intense and forgiving brotherly love, as Randolph struggles to reclaim Byron and to maintain decency against formidable odds. They must deal with the Sicilians who own the gambling, liquor and women and will do anything to hang onto this franchise; the loggers who work and fight in equal part; and each other, not as the boys they were, but as the men they are.</p><p> You might learn more about old-time logging than you ever wanted to know, but the story is as compelling as <i>Cold Mountain</i> or <i>All the Pretty Horses</i> and just as well written. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>&#x201c;Gautreaux writes beautifully about terrible things, about war and life and death . . .

That trial and Alyokhina&#x2019;s subsequent imprisonment became an international cause. For Alyokhina, her two-year sentence launched a bitter struggle against the Russian prison system and an iron-willed refusal to be deprived of her humanity. Teeming with protests and police, witnesses and cellmates, informers and interrogators, <i>Riot Days</i> gives voice to Alyokhina&#x2019;s insistence on the right to say no, whether to a prison guard or to the president. Ultimately, this insistence delivers unprecedented victories for prisoners&#x2019; rights.</p><p>Evocative, wry, laser-sharp, and laconically funny, Alyokhina&#x2019;s account is studded with song lyrics, legal transcripts, and excerpts from her jail diary&#x2015;dispatches from a young woman who has faced tyranny and returned with the proof that against all odds even one person can force its retreat.</p></p><p><b>Maria (Masha) Alyokhina</b> is a founding member of Pussy Riot and a political activist.

Alyokhina takes on a far greater challenge: creating a text that is not just a reflection on a piece of art, but becomes one itself, and one that, in many places, lives up to her own criteria of protest: that it must be &#x2018;desperate, sudden, and joyous.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><b><i>&#x2015;The Guardian</i> </b>(UK)</p><p>&#x201c;Alyokhina&#x2019;s eye for surreal detail gives <i>Riot Days</i> a welcome does of dark humor....

Bookstore staff includes "sex-positive" Lois; bookstore owner Jezanna; wheelchair-bound Thea; and Mo, political grouch in residence. Mo's lover, Harriet, wants to break up and Mo is not taking it well. Yuppie lesbians Toni and Clarice have decided to have a child by artificial insemination. Bechdel's story takes us through their parenting adventure in amusing sequences dealing with frozen-sperm deliveries, breaking the news to parents (or, in Toni's case, pretending there's a father) and the shock of baby-support groups--all subtly illuminating the problems that same-sex couples must face to have children. Bechdel handles Toni's labor and birth (a first for a syndicated comic strip?) with tasteful detail, humor and just the right amount of sentiment. Her black-and-white drawings are charming, carefully conceived and briskly comic. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fight Like a Mother: How a Grassroots Movement Took on the Gun Lobby and Why Women Will Change the World</h2><p><p>Shannon Watts was a stay-at-home mom folding laundry when news of the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary flashed across the television screen. In one moment, she went from outraged to engaged and decided to do something about it. What started as a simple Facebook group to connect with other frustrated parents grew into Moms Demand Action, a national movement with millions of supporters and a powerful grassroots network of local chapters in all 50 states. Shannon has been called "the NRA&#x2019;s worst nightmare&#x201d;&#x2014;and her army of moms have bravely gone up against the gun lobby, showing up in their signature red shirts, blocking the hallways of congress with their strollers, electing gun sense candidates and running for office themselves, proving that if the 80 million moms in this country come together, they can put an end to gun violence.</p><p><em>Fight Like a Mother </em>is the incredible account how one mother&#x2019;s cry for change became the driving force behind gun safety progress. Along with stories of perseverance, courage, and compassion, Watts&nbsp;shines a light on the unique power of women&#x2014;starting with what they have, leading with their maternal strengths, and doubling down instead of backing down. While not everyone can be on the front lines lobbying congress, every mom is already a multi-tasking organizer, and Shannon explains how to go from amateur activist to having a real impact in your community and beyond. <em>Fight Like a Mother</em>&nbsp;will inspire everyone&#x2014;mothers and fathers, students and teachers, lawmakers, and anyone motivated to enact change&#x2014;to get to work transforming hearts and minds, and passing laws that save lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>SHANNON WATTS</strong> is the founder of Mom's Demand Action for Gun Sense in America&#x2014;the leading force for gun violence prevention, with chapters in all 50 states and a powerful grassroots network of moms that has successfully effected change at the local, state and national level.

When kaleidoscope quilter extraordinaire Paula Nadelstern decided to turn her magic loose on a more limited color palette, she drew upon her lifelong love of snowflake photomicrographs to provide inspiration, and <i>Snowflakes &amp; Quilts</i> was born. Intricately detailed, symmetrical, and endlessly fascinating, the snow crystal structure is inherently suited to kaleidoscope quilting. Nadelstern provides expert guidance and strong encouragement as she leads readers through the adventure of conceptualizing the snowflake design, from working with templates and mastering piecing tricks to discovering and understanding appropriate fabrics for this unique application. <p> Nadelstern's skilled way with words is a fine match to her talent with fabrics, making the text a joy to read. She observes, for example, that "printed textiles brimming with synchronous color and pattern deserve credit for catapulting the design way beyond the ordinary." She offers four step-by-step snowflake construction how-tos, and although there are no full-quilt projects here, her superb instruction in all aspects of snowflake quilt design should see experienced quilters well along the way to creating their own lovely snowflake quilts. <i>--Amy Handy</i></p>Paula Nadelstern is a world-renowned quilt artist, author, and teacher.

Charles and Kate Sheridan are pleased to be at the crowning of their king. But when an anarchist accidentally blows himself up with a bomb meant for their monarch, Charles and Kate turn up a number of intriguing--and disturbing--questions. For example, what is mysterious, beautiful Charlotte Conway--editor of the anarchist newspaper where the dead man was employed--doing in the arms of expatriate author Jack London?</p><p>Robin Paige is the pseudonym of husband-and-wife team Susan Wittig Albert and Bill Albert. Susan Wittig Albert is the author of the China Bayles mysteries <b>Thyme of Death, Witch's Bane, Hangman's Root, Rosemary Remembered, Rueful Death, Love Lies Bleeding, Chile Death, Lavender Lies</b>, <b>Mistletoe Man</b>, and <b>Bloodroot</b>. Bill Albert is the coauthor, with his wife, of more than sixty novels for young adults. They live in the Texas hill country.In the 10th entry in this historical husband-and-wife amateur sleuth series (after 2003's Death at Glamis Castle), the pseudonymous Paige makes a less than successful attempt to comment on post&#x2013;9/11 America. Once again, the powers-that-be ask liberal aristocrat Lord Charles Sheridan to investigate a crime, here the detonation of a bomb in Hyde Park that kills a suspected anarchist seemingly en route to Buckingham Palace shortly after the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902. The explosion raises fear of further outrages, and the king's equerry delivers a royal request that Sheridan determine the extent of the terrorist threat. The lord's independent wife, Kate, slips into her usual role as unofficial helper, conducting a parallel inquiry. Atypically, there's no actual mystery to unravel, while the legitimate parallels between Edwardian England's fears of terror attacks and today's U.S. get lost amid heavy-handed touches such as naming the lead Scotland Yarder charged with protecting the British homeland "Ashcraft." Sheridan's speculation about the future invention of something very much like a cellphone is jarringly improbable. Finally, Jack London fans may be dismayed to see London commit a brutal crime that's totally out of character for the real-life adventure writer and socialist. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After months of therapy following Riley's murder, she has finally convinced herself that Brooklyn's demonic possession was all in her head. When her mom gets into a fatal car accident, Sofia has to relocate to a Catholic boarding school. It is old, with a strict morality code. Sofia meets her new roommates, sweet Leena and bad girl Sutton. The protagonist manages to catch the eye of a hot altar boy during mass. He happens to be the same boy whom Leena fancies. As temptation clouds Sofia's judgment, she starts to believe Brooklyn's distant claim that she is indeed evil. Can she resist sinning? This pulse-pounding follow-up to Vega's Merciless focuses on Sofia as she attempts to put the horrible events of the first novel behind her. As Sofia deals with unfamiliar religious surroundings, she begins to think that she's beyond redemption. She tries to find support in friendly Sister Lauren and creepy Father Marcus but can't shake a dark sense of foreboding. With strong, well-developed supporting characters, this novel is a terrifying delight of a read. Sometimes Sofia can't help but give in to her dark side, but readers will be hard-pressed to root against her. This sequel could potentially work as a stand-alone but will be especially enjoyed by fans of the previous volume. With an intensely violent climax, this story will work well for horror readers who don't shy away from prose that may make some readers squeamish.

Loved for its simplicity, health benefits, and because it really works, the diet has been widely imitated since its release. Yet no one knows this plan better than Loren Cordain, its creator. As an expert in evolutionary medicine, Cordain realized we had moved away from the foods we were designed to eat&#x2014;lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables&#x2014;while modern staples such as sugar, salt, and carbohydrates were creating a host of 21st-century health issues, including obesity and heart disease. By eating the right food, people are healthier. But can eating Paleo be tasty?<br><br> In this all-new cookbook with 250 recipes and 75 photos, Cordain makes eating Paleo a pleasure, not a burden.

These are the categories of opposites, of generation, of wisdom, and of virtue. Sister Prudence Allen traces several recurring strands of sexual and gender identity within this period. Ultimately, she shows the paradoxical influence of Aristotle on the question of woman and on a philosophical understanding of sexual coomplemenarity.

The portrayals of Ickenham&#39;s hapless relatives as they&#39;re enmeshed in his nets of imposture and misdirection are classics of their kind. Popular British narrator Frederick Davidson&#39;s male characters are well drawn, from the irascible to the befuddled, and the protagonist Ickenham is presented as properly debonair. But, he fails to distinguish the young women characters, all of whom have the same breathy, fatuously treacly voices. Immensely enjoyable listening. D.W.

Mass emigrations, displaced families, and human alienation from the earth all mark our times.

In these pages is a call to community, to live deeper, to discover that if we have the eyes to see and the imagination to dream it, there is another world at hand where every alien and orphan and estranged executive has a home and family, for there is a kinship that runs deeper than culture or class or biology or nation. There is a family born from a Creator who breathes life into the very dirt, a God who tabernacles with a nomadic group of slaves looking for a land of promise, a Savior who enters the world as a refugee in the middle of a genocide, a homeless rabbi who is leading us home."&nbsp;<b>Mark R.

I drank, I bathed in her radiant purity&#x2019; Jean Bernier says. Leiris writes about her lyrically in fourbis and fr�le bruit as the saint of the chasm.&#x2019; Bataille calls her uncompromising, pure, and sovereign. It is tempting to romanticize Laure in the most sublime and violent sense as consumptive poet, a fervent revolutionary, Bataille&#x2019;s great love. But if she is radiant and dirty, she is also insolent. That, it seems, is what saves her.&#x201d; Jeanine Herman</p><p>"Colette Peignot, a.k.a. Laure, is one of the more fascinating and intense women writers of the past century. Georges Bataille and Michel Leiris described her as one of the most vehement existences [that] ever lived, one of the most conflicted.&#x201d; They summarized her volatile personality as [e]ager for affection and for disaster, oscillating between extreme audacity and the most dreadful anguish, as inconceivable on a scale of real beings as a mythical being, she tore herself on the thorns with which she surrounded herself until becoming nothing but a wound, never allowing herself to be confined by anything or anyone.&#x201d; In other words, Laure was the epitome of what Bataille would dub the sovereign&#x201d; individual." Jason DeBoer,&nbsp;<i>Absinthe Literary Review</i></p><p>"By the time one emerges from this compilation of autobiographical and biographical sketches by and about her, of poems, scattered notes and fevered letters, one can&#x2019;t help feeling that her true masterwork was her ability to make others react to and remember her."&nbsp; Mark Polizzotti,&nbsp;<i>London Review of Books</i></p><p>Laure (1903-1938) was a revolutionary poet, masochist Catholic rich girl, and world traveler. Toward the end of her life she became the lover of French writer Georges Bataille. Her writings and her real life story were remarkable in their violence and intensity, and her relationships with Bataille and Michel Leiris clearly influenced their works.</p><br></p><p>Born in Paris in 1903 to an affluent, conservative Catholic family, Colette Laure Lucienne Peignot rebelled against her bourgeois background. Using the moniker Laure, she recreated herself, adopting a decadent lifestyle, radical politics and an anguished voice for her poetry, prose and essays. Published in English for the first time, these are the collected works of a marginal figure associated with better-known writers and political dissidents of the Parisian avant-garde between the wars. Laure worked for and financed the leftist journal La Critique sociale, which published some of Georges Bataille's most important essays as well as those of other surrealists and Marxists. At 31, she began an intense affair with Bataille, dying in his home four years later of tuberculosis. Laure destroyed much of her writing that, had it survived, might have made this collection a more coherent, cohesive whole. As it is, the book would have benefited from more historical background and explanatory material to aid the general reader. The interest here lies more in how Laure's letters, poems, political essays and journal entries capture the essence of an era and reveal a tortured, self-conscious artist who never had a chance to mature. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.8<br> And If Hardship<br> Animal Artists<br> Archangel Or Whore<br> Bataille<br> The Centaur<br> The Crow<br> Ecce Homo Name By Which One Designates The Depiction Of J.c<br> Esmeralda<br> Everything That Depends Only On Total Integrity.<br> Fragments<br> Go On Even Senseless Later It<br> The God -- Bataille<br> The Greatest Strength<br> I Too Am Well-trained...from Hour To Hour.<br> It Must Be Quite Vexing, This Insidious Worm Consuming The<br> Last Poem: I Saw Her<br> Libertinage: The Stages Of Laure<br> Life Replies -- It Is Not Vain<br> Machiavelli %god %neurosis<br> Outskirts Of Towns<br> Poems (before The Summer Of 1936)<br> Poems And Texts<br> Priests<br> The Sacred<br> Solitude Gnaws Like A Cancer<br> Story Of Donald<br> A Strident Voice Yells And Prevails:<br> This Cadaver Drifting With The Current<br> To Live?

Birds of prey have an aura that few other creatures have. In the acclaimed Hawks in Flight, Pete Dunne showed what birds of prey look like. In The Wind Masters, he shows what it is like to be a bird of prey. He takes us inside the lives and minds of all thirty-four species of diurnal raptors found in North America&nbsp;--&nbsp;hawks, falcons, eagles, vultures, the osprey, and the harrier&nbsp;--&nbsp;and shows us how each bird sees the world, hunts its prey, finds and courts its mate, rears its young, grows up, grows old, and dies.<br> Vividly written, and beautifully illustrated by David Sibley, The Wind Masters is a brilliant work of narrative natural history in the tradition of Peter Matthiessen's The Wind Birds and Barry Lopez's Of Wolves and Men.</p><p>PETE DUNNE forged a bond with nature as a child and has been studying hawks for more than forty&nbsp;years. He has written fifteen books and countless magazine and newspaper columns. He was the founding director of the Cape May Bird Observatory and now serves as New Jersey Audubon&#x2019;s Birding Ambassador. He lives in Mauricetown, New Jersey.<br><br><b>David Sibley</b> is the author of <i>The Sibley Guide to Birds</i> and several other books.What distinguishes birds of prey from other birds is that they exhibit so many modes of flight; they have mastered the wind in every conceivable manner, the author points out. Dunne introduces 34 species of diurnal raptors?kites, vultures, falcons, eagles, hawks, harriers and ospreys. He presents his material anecdotally in fictional settings that include all the significant factors of raptor life. This approach is effective for most subjects, but a wisecracking raven in his story of a lead-poisoned, dying golden eagle seems inappropriate. Generally, Dunne attempts to convey what it is like to be a bird of prey, especially when it is airborne. There are dramatic stories: a Peregrine falcon defending her nest from a wolverine, a rough-leffed hawk struggling offshore. Dunne's vivid descriptions are matched by Sibley's fine illustrations. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Slow Manifesto: Lebbeus Woods Blog</h2><p>In the fall of 2007, Lebbeus Woods (1940&#x2013;2012), long admired for his visionary architecture and mastery of drawing, began a blog. Part forum and part public journal, the eclectic mix of articles, drawings, anecdotes, poetry, interviews, and photographic essays explored topics ranging from architectural theory and criticism to education and politics.

"Harpoon," the creation of Mossad legend Meir Dagan, directed spies, soldiers, and attorneys to disrupt and destroy money pipelines and financial institutions that paid for the bloodshed perpetrated by Hamas, Hezbollah, and other groups. Written by an attorney who worked with Harpoon and a bestselling journalist, <i>Harpoon </i>offers a gripping story of the Israeli-led effort, now joined by the Americans, to choke off the terrorists' oxygen supply, money, via unconventional warfare.</p><p><b>Nitsana Darshan-Leitner </b>is an Israeli activist and attorney.

Paul Perlman, P.E., is a retired structural engineer who spent most of his career as a consulting engineer for the brick industry. However, from the time he designed and built his first home&#x2014;a tree house wired for electricity&#x2014;at age twelve, Paul has been passionate about architecture. Paul designed and built his second home (for grown ups!) in 1976 and has been studying all aspects of residential architecture, particularly green design, ever since. With his understanding of engineering and construction and his passion for good design, he has singlehandedly redesigned, remodeled and built more than two dozen homes. Throughout his life, he has continued to explore the intersection of psychology, design, and sustainability. The question that has driven him to keep exploring and trying new things is: how can physical design foster a sense of emotional well-being? When he discovered the book &#x201c;A Pattern Language&#x201d; by Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa and Murray Silverstein, he found his answers. Perlman believes that our future homes will, by necessity, be small. This book illustrates eight small homes and tiny cottages that incorporate his design ideas based on &#x201c;A Pattern Language.&#x201d; Unlike most &#x201c;small home&#x201d; designs, these designs incorporate the surrounding environment and are unrestricted by architectural norms. His hope is that other people will come to appreciate the joy of living in a home that is both well designed and ecologically efficient. In this book, Perlman discusses: � the most valuable design features that give our home a sense of emotional comfort and well-being � how to have a home that feels more spacious with less square footage � how to make high-density neighborhoods feel more inviting</p><p></p><h2>Justice Buried</h2><p>In an effort to get her security consulting business off the ground, Kelsey Allen has been spending a lot of time up in the air, rappelling down buildings and climbing through windows to show business owners their vulnerabilities to thieves.

Lines from his comic, erotic, tragic poem Venus and Adonis were on everyone&#39;s lips.The appearance in 1594 of the darkly reflective and richly descriptive Rape of Lucrece confirmed his fame as &#39;Sweet Master Shakespeare&#39;, Elizabethan England&#39;s most brilliant non-dramatic poet. Shorter poems in this volume testify further to Shakespeare&#39;s versatility and to his poetic fame. Some, like the much-debated `Phoenix and Turtle&#39;, pose problems of meaning; others raise questions about authorship and authenticity.

In <i>The Curves of Life, </i>Sir Theodore A. Cook (1867&#x2013;1928), English author and editor, finds that the spiral or helix may lie at the core of life's first principle &#x2014; that of growth. The spiral is fundamental to the structure of plants, shells, and the human body; to the periodicity of atomic elements and to an animal's horns; to microscopic DNA (the double helix) and to the Andromeda nebula.<br><i>The Curves of Life </i>portrays the significance of the spiral in 426 illustrations, from a Narwhal's tusk to D�rer's plan for a cylindrical helix. From the spiral in nature, science, and art, the author suggests ideas on the essence of beauty and man's response to it. "One of the chief beauties of the spiral as an imaginative conception is that it is always growing, yet never covering the same ground, so that it is not merely an explanation of the past, but is also a prophecy of the future."<br>Martin Gardner, mathematician and author, said of <i>The Curves of Life, </i>"This is <i>the </i>classic reference on how the golden ratio applies to spirals and helices in nature."</p></p><p></p><h2>Dead Calm (A Mattie Winston Mystery)</h2><p>As deputy medical examiner and homicide detective respectively, newlyweds Mattie Winston and Steve Hurley are dispatched to a grisly crime scene at the Grizzly Motel, a seedy joint for illicit liaisons on the outskirts of Sorenson, Wisconsin.

Lilly takes readers behind the scenes into the inner life of a scientist exploring inner space, or far-out spaces,&#x201d; as Lilly called them. The book explains how he derived his theory of the operations of the human mind and brain from his personal experiences and experiments in solitude, isolation, and confinement; LSD; and other methods of mystical experience. It also includes glimpses into Lilly's friendship with such 1960s' notables as Oscar Ichazo, Ram Dass, Timothy Leary, Albert Hofmann, Fritz Perls, and Claudio Narajo. Written for the non-specialist, <i>Center of the Cyclone</i> shows an important, modern thinker at his most personal and profound.</p><p></p><h2>The Secular Enlightenment</h2><p><p><b>A major new history of how the Enlightenment transformed people&#x2019;s everyday lives</b></p><p><i>The Secular Enlightenment</i> is a panoramic account of the radical ways that life began to change for ordinary people in the age of Locke, Voltaire, and Rousseau. In this landmark book, familiar Enlightenment figures share places with voices that have remained largely unheard until now, from freethinkers and freemasons to French materialists, anticlerical Catholics, pantheists, pornographers, readers, and travelers.</p><p>Margaret Jacob, one of our most esteemed historians of the Enlightenment, reveals how this newly secular outlook was not a wholesale rejection of Christianity but rather a new mental space in which to encounter the world on its own terms. She takes readers from London and Amsterdam to Berlin, Vienna, Turin, and Naples, drawing on rare archival materials to show how ideas central to the emergence of secular democracy touched all facets of daily life. Human frailties once attributed to sin were now viewed through the lens of the newly conceived social sciences. People entered churches not to pray but to admire the architecture, and spent their Sunday mornings reading a newspaper or even a risqu� book. The secular-minded pursued their own temporal and commercial well-being without concern for the life hereafter, regarding their successes as the rewards for their actions, their failures as the result of blind economic forces.</p><p>A majestic work of intellectual and cultural history, <i>The Secular Enlightenment</i> demonstrates how secular values and pursuits took hold of eighteenth-century Europe, spilled into the American colonies, and left their lasting imprint on the Western world for generations to come.</p></p><p><b>Margaret C. Jacob</b> is Distinguished Professor of History at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her many books include <i>The Radical Enlightenment: Pantheists, Freemasons, and Republicans</i> and <i>The First Knowledge Economy: Human Capital and the European Economy, 1750&#x2013;1850</i>. She lives in Los Angeles.&#x201c;Jacob is concerned with the social history of the Enlightenment&#x2015;with how it was experienced, and not just by its luminaries. Popular almanacs, private diaries of those not normally at the center of historical attention, and the expansion of publishing into new and sometimes quite provocative genres all provide the worldliness she seeks to reveal with a more democratic horizon.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;John H.

What emerges in his sessions with the psychiatrist Balthazar, however, is something far more complex&#x2014;and unfathomably more sinister&#x2014;than neurosis. Lawrence Durrell&#x2019;s kaleidoscopic narrative ushers us into a world in which no perception is reliable&#x2014;and love itself is always an act of treachery.<br><br> &#x201c;Durrell is one of the very best novelists of our time. . . .

He attended the Jesuit College at Darjeeling and St. Edmund's School, Canterbury. His first literary work, <i>The Black Book</i>, appeared in Paris in 1938. His first collection of poems, <i>A Private Country</i>, was published in 1943, followed by the three Island books: <i>Prospero's Cell</i>; <i>Reflections on a Marine Venus</i>, about Rhodes; and <i>Bitter Lemons</i>, his account of life in Cyprus. Durrell's wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece, <i>The Alexandria Quartet</i>, which he completed in southern France, where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the quartet and <i>The Avignon Quintet</i> he wrote the two-decker <i>Tunc </i>and <i>Nunquam</i>. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writing, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps. <i>Caesar's Vast Ghost</i>, his reflections on the history and culture of Provence, including a late flowering of poems, was published a few days before his death in Sommi�res in 1990.[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with JUSTINE, MOUNTOLIVE, and CLEA.]--The four linked novels that comprise English author Lawrence Durrell's masterpiece, THE ALEXANDRIA QUARTET, are set in Alexandria, Egypt, around the time of WWII. The four novels explore the city's polyglot society, full of intrigue, mystery, and sensuality, telling essentially the same story from different points of view. JUSTINE focuses on the beautiful Jewish wife of a wealthy Copt. Her story is told by Darley, her English lover. In BALTHAZAR, Darley reconsiders and retells the story he told in Justine, using information from a mysterious new character, Balthazar. In MOUNTOLIVE, as war begins to loom, British Ambassador David Mountolive enters the intrigues of the interwoven community of characters. In CLEA, Darley returns to a war-fevered Alexandria as the stories of the many characters move toward conclusion. Narrator Nigel Anthony provides a brilliant reading, keeping the variety of voices--English, French, Egyptian--distinct throughout. He offers a one-man play, conveying the passions, disappointments, and triumphs of the complex cast. The classical music interludes that delineate sections of this beautifully produced and packaged set help transport the listener to back- streets of Alexandria. R.E.K.

Auden and Louis MacNeice visited Iceland on commission to write a travel book, but found themselves capturing concerns on a scale that were far more international. &#39;Though writing in a &#34;holiday&#34; spirit,&#39; commented Auden, &#39;its authors were all the time conscious of a threatening horizon to their picnic - world-wide unemployment, Hitler growing everyday more powerful and a world-war more inevitable.&#39; The result is the remarkable Letters from Iceland, a collaboration in poetry and prose, reportage and correspondence, published in 1937 with the Spanish Civil War newly in progress, beneath the shadow of looming world war.</p><p>W. H. Auden&#39;s first book, Poems, was published by T. S. Eliot at Faber in 1930. He went to Spain during the civil war, to Iceland and later travelled to China. In 1939 he and Christopher Isherwood left for America. He died in Vienna in 1973. Louis MacNeice was born in Belfast in 1907. His first book of poems, Blind Fireworks, appeared in 1929. The Burning Perch, his last volume of poems, appeared shortly before his death in 1963.</p><h2>Batik Gems: 29 Dazzling Quilt Projects by Shifrin, Laurie</h2><p>Make 29 vibrant batik quilts in colors that span the rainbow and sizes from crib to king size.</p><p>Laurie Shifrin, an acclaimed studio quilt artists, is an internationally sought-after quilting teacher and lecturer.</p><h2>The Experience of Samadhi: An In-depth Exploration of Buddhist Meditation</h2><p>Dharma practice comprises a wide range of wise instructions and skillful means.

These discussions focus on the practical experience of samadhi, bringing the theoretical to life and offering a range of applications of the different meditation techniques.</p><p>Richard Shankman is a Buddhist meditation teacher with nearly four decades&#39; experience in meditation practice and study.

In fact, George Washington&#x2019;s first fight for independence was from his controlling, singular mother. </strong></p><p>Stubborn, aristocratic Mary Ball Washington was entrenched in the Old World ways of her ancestors, dismissing the American experiment even as her son led the successful rebellion against the crown. During his youth, ambitious George dove into the hard-scrabble work of a surveyor and rose through the ranks of the fledgling colonial army, even as his overprotective mother tried to discourage these efforts.</p><p>Mary&#x2019;s influence on George was twofold. Though she raised her eldest son to become one of the world&#x2019;s greatest leaders, Mary also tried many times to hold him back. While she passed down her strength and individuality to George, she also sought to protect him from the risks he needed to take to become a daring general and president. But it was this resistance itself which fanned the spark of George&#x2019;s independence into a flame. The constant tug of war between the two throughout the early years helped define George&#x2019;s character.</p><p>In <em>Mary Ball Washington</em>, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Craig Shirley uncovers startling details about the inner workings of the Washington family. He vividly brings to life a resilient widow who singlehandedly raised six children and ran a large farm at a time when most women&#x2019;s duties were relegated to household matters. Throughout, Shirley compares and contrasts mother and son, illuminating the qualities they shared and the differences that divided them. </p><p>A significant contribution to American history, <em>Mary Ball Washington</em> is the definitive take on the relationship between George and Mary Washington, offering fresh insight into this extraordinary figure who would shape our nation&#x2014;and the woman who shaped him.</p><p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Craig Shirley is the author of <em>Reagan Rising, Rendezvous with Destiny</em>,<em> Reagan&#x2019;s Revolution</em>,<em> Last Act</em> and the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>December 1941</em>.

Plus: Zap�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s first-and-only color section, featuring comics by R. Crumb and Gilbert Shelton (his final Zap Wonder Wart-hog episode, no less). Paul Mavrides provides an alternately embellished version of Gilbert Shelton�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s and his Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers episode, �&#x20ac;&#x153;Phineas Becomes a Suicide Bomber�&#x20ac; (originally inked in the Complete Zap by Shelton). Front cover by R. Crumb. Back cover by Moscoso.</p><p><p>Born in Philadelphia, <strong>R.

His books include&nbsp;<em>The Book of Genesis Illustrated by R. Crumb</em>, and many more. He lives in the south of France with his wife, the artist Aline Kominsky-Crumb.</p><p>In addition to being one of the seven, original&nbsp;<em>Zap Comix</em>&nbsp;contributors,&nbsp;<strong>Robert Williams</strong>&#x2019;s influence on alternative art is immeasurable. From his endeavors to broaden the possibilities for young artists to gain exposure sprang the well-known art chronicle<em>,&nbsp;Juxtapoz</em>&nbsp;magazine.

Crumb, Robert Williams, Gilbert Shelton, Spain Rodriguez, S. Clay Wilson and Rick Griffin). He lives with his wife Gail in San Francisco, California.</p>An iconic anthology bows out in a long-unpublished final issue featuring all of its premier artists, showcasing the differing styles that made each creator famous. Crumb&#39;s self-reflective comics (often published alongside those of Aline Kominsky-Crumb, the first woman ever to appear in Zap) are strong, with his distinctive griminess and nervous faces cowering under piles of looming word balloons. Kominsky-Crumb&#39;s thin lines contrast well against her husband&#39;s dense drawings, and their discussions are often touching in their bald honesty. Shelton lampoons the 21st-century need for all heroes to kill in the last Wonder Wart-Hog strip. His lines in this and another story, about a loser who becomes a terrorist to get laid, have a Mad magazine feel. Wilson&#39;s shock comics are the weak link for today&#39;s readers now that nudity is common in mainstream monthly books. While many have fond memories of Zap as one of the first to break the rules, much of the transgression is now common or unnecessary.

Working in an eclectic and sometimes controversial blend of modernist styles, they produced what an English critic celebrated in the 1920s as the most vital group of paintings&#x201d; of the 20th century. Inspired by C�zanne, Van Gogh and other modernist artists, they tried to interpret the Ontario landscape in light of the strategies of the international avant-garde. Based after 1914 in the purpose-built Studio Building for Canadian Art, the young artists embarked on what Lawren Harris called an all-engrossing adventure&#x201d;: travelling north into the anadian Shield and forging a style of painting appropriate to what they regarded as the unique features of Canada&#x2019;s northern landscape.<br><br>Sumptuously illustrated, rigorously researched and drawn from archival documents and letters, Defiant Spirits constitutes a group biography,&#x201d; reconstructing the men&#x2019;s aspirations, frustrations and achievements.

When their mean teacher Miss Ribble gets her hands on the comic book, their troubles really begin.<p> Fans who have been eagerly awaiting Book 5 in the series, preceded by such gems as <i>Captain Underpants and the Invasion of the Incredibly Naughty Cafeteria Ladies from Outer Space</i> and <i>Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants</i>, will heave a sigh of relief at the appearance of Pilkey's latest tongue-in-cheek superhero adventure novel. Goofier than ever, with plenty of boyish drawings and juvenile humor, this lightweight chapter book is the answer to reluctant (and avid) readers' dreams. If descriptions of Wedgie Woman's bionic hair and the "ubrupt" ending of the "happyness" on the planet of Underpantyworld don't turn grade-schoolers into bookworms, what will? By the way, don't let the quotation from Einstein at the front of the book mislead you; this is lowbrow humor at its very finest. (Ages 8 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Dav Pilkey has written and illustrated numerous popular, award-winning books for children, including the Captain Underpants and Dumb Bunnies series; <i>Dog Breath</i>, winner of the California Young Reader Medal; and <i>The Paperboy</i>, a Caldecott Honor Book.

That's close to a modern day miracle, and this book describes the breakthrough perfectly."<br>--Jesse Hanley, M.D., Medical Director, Malibu Health and Rehabilitation</p><p>Touted as the fountain of youth in pill form, DHEA, or dehydroepiandrosterone, is a hormone naturally produced by the body. The young body, that is; by age 85, you produce 95 percent less DHEA than at age 25. Stephen Cherniske, a biochemist who has tracked the research on DHEA for years, has compiled a handy reference to help sort out the hype from this hormone's reported helpfulness for boosting libido and immune function, improving bone density, aiding weight loss, relieving depression and atherosclerosis, and even reducing the size of tumors. <p> DHEA is inexpensive and readily available in health food stores or through the Web; that's about where the simplicity wears off. It's not regulated by the FDA, so recommended doses vary widely, from 10 to 50 milligrams or more a day. It's also available in both natural and chemical forms, and, unfortunately, sometimes in combination with potentially dangerous stimulants such as ephedra, an herb that has been shown to cause insomnia and an irregular heartbeat. Cherniske gives suggestions for which type of DHEA to buy and in what doses, depending on such things as your age and activity level, as well as recommended sources. He also provides a "longevity program" with suggested co-supplements, such as ginseng and vitamin B6, along with exercises suited to even the completely out-of-shape, to optimize the effectiveness of the DHEA. There's also information about the ins and outs of DHEA testing and how to analyze your results (Cherniske reminds us that "normal" often tells us nothing), and potential side effects for both women and men. Overall, Cherniske does an excellent job of separating fact from fiction about this controversial but quite extraordinary supplement.</p>Stephen Cherniske is one of this county's premier researchers in DHEA. He was studying and testing DHEA years before most of the currently touted "experts." Additionally, he is living and breathing proof that a sensible, tailored lifeplan - - including DHEA - - can make an amazing contribution to health, outlook, and appearance. Reading DHEA BREAKTHROUGH is like being in the same room and having a conversation with Stephen: his voice, energy, charm, and recommendations are immediate and tangible.<br><br>Cathy Repetti<br>Associate Publisher</p><h2>Dissolving the Ego, Realizing the Self: Contemplations from the Teachings of David R</h2><p>How does one traverse the spiritual landscape to move beyond suffering to experience the peace and love of God, to transcend illusion and realize the state of enlightenment?

Published at long last, in her ninety-first year, this book includes ninety of her photographs along with a conversation in which Welty shares her impressions and her memories of the 1930s and 1940s when she rambled through Mississippi cemeteries taking pictures. She recalls poignant and sometimes chilling experiences that occurred. </p><p>"I took a lot of cemetery pictures in my life," she said. "For me cemeteries had a sinister appeal somehow." Her camera eye focused on distinctive funerary emblems, statuary, storied urns, and appealing folklife qualities expressed in the gravestones. Just as many pieces of Welty's fiction feature lyrical descriptions of cemeteries and graves in a way that is expressly Weltian, so too do these photographs taken in the cool, sequestered churchyards and graveyards of Jackson, Port Gibson, Churchill, Rodney, Utica, Crystal Springs, Vicksburg, Rocky Springs, and sites near the old Natchez Trace. </p><p>They not only document her rambles but also accent the images of regional cemeteries that appear in her stories and novels. This is her unique view of the southern graveyard and of its unusual artworks that arrested her attention -- chains, willows, baskets, angels, lambs, pointing hands, doves, and wreaths. "I like the tombstones showing children asleep in seashells," she says. For her, an absorbed observer, there is charm in the stone motifs and in the sentimental modes of commemorating the dead. </p><p>As a contemplative loner she called no attention to herself as she wandered quietly through small-town cemeteries with her camera. Both the country settings and the heart-felt inscriptions on decaying marble heightened her imagination and triggered her creative impulses. </p><p>Accompanying the photographs are selected passages about graveyards and funerals from her fiction -- <i>Losing Battles</i>, <i>The Golden Apples and Other Stories</i>, <i>A Curtain of Green and Other Stories</i>, and T<i>he Optimist's Daughter</i> -- and from her essay "Some Notes on River Country." </p><p>In the introduction Elizabeth Spencer, a Mississippi writer who has been a life-long friend of Welty's, explores the photographic images for the meanings they yield, for the light they throw onto Welty's fiction, and for her own memories of their home state's evocative graveyards and burial customs. </p><p>Eudora Welty, one of America's most acclaimed and honored writers, is the author of many novels and story collections, including <i>The Optimist's Daughter</i> (Pulitzer Prize), <i>Losing Battles</i>, <i>The Ponder Heart</i>, <i>The Robber Bridegroom</i>, and <i>A Curtain of Green and Other Stories</i> and two collections of her photographic work <i>Photographs</i> and <i>One Time, One Place: Mississippi in the Depression</i> (both from University Press of Mississippi).</p></p><p><p>Welty?s poignant photographs of Mississippi graveyards and memorial stones paired with Spencer?s exploration of the meanings the photographs yield and the light they shine onto Welty?s fiction</p><b>Eudora Welty </b>is author of many novels and story collections, including <i>The Optimist?s Daughter</i> (winner of the Pulitzer Prize), <i>Losing Battles</i>, <i>The Ponder Heart</i>, <i>The Robber Bridegroom</i>, <i>A Curtain of Green and Other Stories</i>, as well as three collections of her photographic work?<i>Photographs</i>, <i>Country Churchyards</i>, and <i>One Time, One Place: Mississippi in the Depression</i>, all published by University Press of Mississippi.</p><h2>Asterix and the Great Crossing: Album #22</h2><p>Land ho!

This despite the fact that he is the only US president to be baptized as a Christian while in office.<br><br>Alan Sears and Craig Osten invite you on a journey that is unique in American history and is essential to understanding one of the most consequential, admired, and complex Americans of the 20th Century.

This is the untold story of a man whose growing faith sustained him through the loss of a young son, marital difficulties, depression, career disappointments, and being witness to some of the worst atrocities humankind has devised. A man whose faith was based in his own sincere personal conviction, not out of a sense of political expediency or social obligation.<br><br>You've met Dwight Eisenhower the soldier and Dwight Eisenhower the president.

That's a recipe for success at any level."--<b>Jim Daly</b>, president of Focus on the Family<br><br>"Dwight Eisenhower is remembered as a man skilled in the arts of both war and peace, a leader whose instinctive civility is sorely missed in an age of bitter political acrimony.

On June 3,1835, he went inside his small Normandy house with a pruning hook&nbsp;and cut to death his mother, his eighteen-year-old sister, and his seven-year-old brother. Then, in jail, he wrote a memoir to justify the whole gruesome tale. <p>Michel Foucault, author of <i>Madness and Civilization and Discipline and Punish</i>, collected the relevant documents of the case, including medical and legal testimony, police records. and Rivi�re's memoir. The Rivi�re case, he points out, occurred at a time when many professions were contending for status and power. Medical authority was challenging law, branches of government were vying.

Koenig addresses federal, state, and local government policy leaders, urging them to more fully integrate religious organizations into the formal disaster response system, and he then provides recommendations on how this can effectively be done. Koenig also advocates faith communities and organizations to learn more about the role they can play in responding to disasters and terrorism.</p> <p>The chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina made extraordinarily clear the gaps in the United States' disaster policies. At the same time, the contributions of organized faith communities were highlights amidst the bungled federal, state, and local responses. One example is the <i>New York Times</i>, September 9, 2005, headline: "A New Meaning for 'Organized Religion': It Helps the Needy Quickly." But as faith-based organizations look for ways to help, there are few, if any, guidelines for them.</p> <p> </p> <p>This book provides information on the psychological, social, and spiritual responses to trauma. It addresses how the emergency response system works, and the role that religious communities can play in disaster response and recovery in terms of providing emotional and spiritual care for victims. It advocates integrating mental health into emergency response systems directed at those affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and terrorism. "The aim is to help victims of disaster to better cope with the stresses they face, as well as help direct care workers (firefighters, police, health care providers, etc.) to deal better emotionally with the trauma to which they are exposed so they can remain effective and functional on the job," explains</p> <p>Dr. Koenig, whose research on the healing power of faith has been published worldwide.</p> <p> </p> <p>Increasing the resiliency of our communities in the face of disaster is crucial. Religious communities have tremendous potential to contribute to this. Here are guidelines on how to do that more effectively, alongside data on how to facilitate the integration of these contributions with the formal disaster-response system.</p></p><p><p>Harold G.

It describes the skeleton as not just a structure, but a working system in the living body. The opening chapter introduces basics of osteology, or the study of bones, the specialized and often confusing terminology of the field, and methods for dealing scientifically with bone specimens. The second chapter covers the biology of living bone: its structure, growth, interaction with the rest of the body, and response to disease and injury. The remainder of the book is a head-to-foot, structure-by-structure, bone-by-bone tour of the skeleton. More than 400 photographs and drawings and more than 80 tables illustrate and analyze features the text describes. In each chapter structures are discussed in detail so that not only can landmarks of bones be identified, but their functions can be understood and their anomalies identified as well. Each bone&#39;s articulating partners are listed, and the sequence of ossification of each bone is presented. Descriptive sections are followed by analyses of applications: how to use specific bones to estimate age, stature, gender, biological affinities, and state of health at the time of the individual&#39;s death. Anthropologists, archaeologists, and paleontologists as well as physicians, medical examiners, anatomists, and students of these disciplines will find this an invaluable reference and textbook.</p><p>D.

For women, it just might be. This unsettling and original book offers a radical new understanding of the context-dependent nature of female sexuality. <b>Lisa M. Diamond</b> argues that for some women, love and desire are not rigidly heterosexual or homosexual but fluid, changing as women move through the stages of life, various social groups, and, most important, different love relationships.<br>This perspective clashes with traditional views of sexual orientation as a stable and fixed trait. But that view is based on research conducted almost entirely on men. Diamond is the first to study a large group of women over time. She has tracked one hundred women for more than ten years as they have emerged from adolescence into adulthood. She summarizes their experiences and reviews research ranging from the psychology of love to the biology of sex differences. <i>Sexual Fluidity</i> offers moving first-person accounts of women falling in and out of love with men or women at different times in their lives. For some, gender becomes irrelevant: &#x201c;I fall in love with the person, not the gender,&#x201d; say some respondents.<br><i>Sexual Fluidity</i> offers a new understanding of women&#x2019;s sexuality&#x2015;and of the central importance of love.</p><p>Lisa M. Diamond is Associate Professor of Psychology and Gender Studies at the University of Utah.&#x201c;<i>Sexual Fluidity</i> is the most important book on sexuality in many years. The scholarship is impeccable and the writing lucid. Exploring issues that have political, scientific, and personal ramifications, Diamond answers the tough questions: Do women have a sexual orientation? Do women choose their sexuality? Can a heterosexual woman fall in love with a woman? Can a lesbian fall in love with a man? Are women really sexually changeable? Are men? Diamond challenges both traditionalists and radicals&#x2015;if you want to understand female sexuality, listen to what women say.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ritch C. Savin-Williams, author of <i>The New Gay Teenager</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The book raises fundamental questions about women's sexuality. Lisa Diamond's comprehensive analysis of the scientific evidence illuminates the interconnections of love, sex and sexual identity in women's lives. Her analysis of sexual fluidity is both original and compelling.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anne Peplau, University of California, Los Angeles</b><br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating and certain to be controversial... Diamond says traditional labels for sexual desire are inadequate; for some women even 'bisexual' does not truly express the protean nature of their sexuality. Diamond details in accessible and nuanced language her own study of 100 young women (by her own admission not 'fully representative') over a period of 10 years. She says that she is 'calling for an expanded understanding of same-sex sexuality' that could radically affect both LGBT activists who hold that sexual identity is fixed and antigay groups who believe sexuality is chosen.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Freud once asked: 'What do women want?' He did not really know. In this beautiful and scholarly book, Diamond has attempted to answer his question. In her study of 100 young women growing up in the postmodern era, she has found that what women want is far more complex than was previously thought and cannot easily be answered with a simple theory. This book will be read by students and scholars across the social and biological sciences. It is a gift to be cherished.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ken Zucker, University of Toronto</b><br><br>&#x201c;Captivating, nuanced, and rigorous... Diamond's work is vital precisely because sexual fluidity is not a new concept&#x2015;Freud called his version 'polymorphous perversity'&#x2015;but merely one that is typically dismissed. Nor is it news to women, particularly not to a generation for whom a nonspecific 'queer' affiliation, or no affiliation at all, is increasingly common. What is so important is not that this fluidity exists, but that someone has finally paid it systematic attention and found that it is in fact not the exception, but may well be the rule.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Hanne Blank</b><b>, </b><b><i>Ms.</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Traditionally, female sexuality has been presumed to work in the same way and by the same rules as male sexual identity, but Diamond argues that for women, sexual identity isn't fixed in the same categories.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Temma Ehrenfeld</b><b>, </b><b><i>Psychologies</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Setting out to prove the theory that, for some women, love is truly blind where gender is concerned, Diamond presents her evidence in a fascinating, anecdotal fashion&#x2015;by tracking over the span of a decade the relationships of nearly 100 women who at one point or another had experienced 'same-sex attractions.' The women move from men to women and back again (or vice-versa), their sexual identity as changeable as their desires. Additionally, she delves into the brain science behind lust, love and infatuation, revealing that what draws women toward a particular partner is as much a function of biology as it is anything else. To her credit, Diamond avoids scripting her arguments in obtuse academese. With her compassionate, understated approach, she has stepped up the business of gender research.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lily Burana</b><b>, </b><b><i>Washington Post Book World</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating read.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The book has many riveting accounts by women of their own experiences of sexual attraction and distraction... Diamond has written a fascinating book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Adam Phillips</b><b>, </b><b><i>London Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Diamond] did something unique, following 100 female subjects with same-sex attractions for 10 years...

Spurred by a dream in which Aristotle appeared to him, he rejected the Avicennan Peripatetic philosophy of his youth and undertook the task of reviving the philosophical tradition of the "Ancients." <br><br>Suhruwardi's philosophy grants an epistemological role to immediate and atemporal intuition. It is explicitly anti-Peripatetic and is identified with the pre-Aristotelian sages, particularly Plato. The subject of his <i>hikmat al-Ishraq</i>&#x2014;now available for the first time in English&#x2014;is the "science of lights," a science that Suhrawardi first learned through mystical exercises reinforced later by logical proofs and confirmed by what he saw as the parallel experiences of the Ancients. It was completed on 15 September 1186; and at sunset that evening, in the western sky, the sun, the moon, and the five visible planets came together in a magnificent conjunction in the constellation of Libra. The stars soon turned against Suhrawardi, however, who was reluctantly put to death by the son of Saladin, the sultan of Egypt, in 1191.</p><p><b>John Walbridge </b>is professor of Near Eastern languages and cultures at Indiana University Bloomington. <br>Text: English, Arabic (translation)<br> Original Language: Arabic</p><h2>Normative Ethics (Dimensions of Philosophy)</h2><p>Providing a thorough introduction to current philosophical views on morality, <i>Normative Ethics</i> examines an act's rightness or wrongness in light of such factors as consequences, harm, and consent.

Bagehot's book set down the principles that helped define the role of modern central banks, particularly in times of crisis--but the recent global financial meltdown has posed unforeseen challenges. <i>The New Lombard Street</i> lays out the innovative principles needed to address the instability of today's markets and to rebuild our financial system.</p><br><p> Revealing how we arrived at the current crisis, Perry Mehrling traces the evolution of ideas and institutions in the American banking system since the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913. He explains how the Fed took classic central banking wisdom from Britain and Europe and adapted it to America's unique and considerably more volatile financial conditions. Mehrling demonstrates how the Fed increasingly found itself serving as the dealer of last resort to ensure the liquidity of securities markets--most dramatically amid the recent financial crisis. Now, as fallout from the crisis forces the Fed to adapt in unprecedented ways, new principles are needed to guide it. In <i>The New Lombard Street</i>, Mehrling persuasively argues for a return to the classic central bankers' "money view," which looks to the money market to assess risk and restore faith in our financial system.</p></p><p><p>"The global financial system is badly broken. Many institutions and individuals share responsibility for the development of pathologies in and around our largest banks, but the buck stops, literally and figuratively, with the Federal Reserve. If you would like to understand how this happened--and how we (and the Fed) might inch back from the precipice--read this book."<b>--Simon Johnson, coauthor of <i>13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown</i></b></p><p>"Informed by history, a model of clear thought and lucid prose, <i>The New Lombard Street</i> is by far our best guidebook to the changed structure of financial markets and the new role of the Federal Reserve. It also charts a new path for monetary policymakers and--given the scale of the crisis--not a minute too soon."<b>--James K. Galbraith, author of <i>The Predator State: How Conservatives Abandoned the Free Market and Why Liberals Should Too</i></b></p><p>"In <i>Lombard Street</i>, Walter Bagehot laid out the financial market lore and central banking wisdom of his day--the 1870s. Today's markets are different, and so is what constitutes useful policy. In <i>The New Lombard Street</i>, Perry Mehrling blends his rich historical knowledge with an acute analysis of current-day markets to suggest what constitutes sound central banking and financial regulation for our time. The result merits close attention from policymakers, and the rest of us too."<b>--Benjamin M. Friedman, author of <i>The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth</i></b></p><p>"No one else has come close to the achievement of this book in relating the crisis to the prior history of monetary thought and central bank practice. A masterful, original, and beautifully constructed work."<b>--Charles A. E. Goodhart, London School of Economics and Political Science</b></p><p>"<i>The New Lombard Street</i> makes a serious and successful effort to deepen our understanding not just of the last century or more of U.S. monetary history, but also of the way in which economic analysis has evolved alongside that history.

But there's another kind of entity that can be far smarter: groups of people. In this groundbreaking book, Thomas Malone, the founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, shows how groups of people working together in superminds -- like hierarchies, markets, democracies, and communities -- have been responsible for almost all human achievements in business, government, science, and beyond. And these collectively intelligent human groups are about to get much smarter. <br><br>Using dozens of striking examples and case studies, Malone shows how computers can help create more intelligent superminds simply by connecting humans to one another in a variety of rich, new ways. And although it will probably happen more gradually than many people expect, artificially intelligent computers will amplify the power of these superminds by doing increasingly complex kinds of thinking. Together, these changes will have far-reaching implications for everything from the way we buy groceries and plan business strategies to how we respond to climate change, and even for democracy itself. By understanding how these collectively intelligent groups work, we can learn how to harness their genius to achieve our human goals. <br> <br>Drawing on cutting-edge science and insights from a remarkable range of disciplines, <i>Superminds</i> articulates a bold -- and utterly fascinating -- picture of the future that will change the ways you work and live, both with other people and with computers.<br><br></p><p><b>Thomas W.

The country of Greece is supposedly run by six or seven venal and unprincipled families; in a sense, the same thing can be said of the thieves, shroffs, and mountebanks who have been bilking this nation for years. Wall Street brokers are <i>worse</i> by far than common highwaymen, as are certified banks. If &#x2018;corporations are people,&#x2019; as Gov. Mitt Romney insists, then they should all be tried, sentenced, and hanged! <i>Read this book!</i>&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Alexander Theroux, award-winning author of <i>Darconville&#x2019;s Cat</i><br> &#x201c;1912: Most of the survivors of the Titanic catastrophe were the first-class passengers.

If you&#x2019;re a poor 55-year-old man in America, you could reach 77.6. At 55, a rich American male can expect to last to nearly 90. It&#x2019;s not Darwin&#x2019;s survival of the fittest, it&#x2019;s &#x201c;natural&#x201d; selection bought, sold, and corrupted in a world where the rich make all the rules. It&#x2019;s <i>Survival of the Richest</i>. No matter how much or little you have, this book will piss you off.

Corsi, author of <i>Obama Nation </i> and <i>America for Sale</i><br> &#x201c;Written with clarity and passion, Donald Jeffries take us down the dark winding path of rich versus poor and along the way spares no one.

Where are the statesmen? Where are the humanitarians? Why do the very rich not invest in the poor or in society like their predecessors did? This is a story that needs to be told.

Examining topics as diverse as immigration, globalization, government bailouts, and celebrity salaries, Jeffries compiles an abundance of statistical information that could just as easily be used to support or refute conventional wisdom regarding the country&#x2019;s economic foundation and future. This wide-ranging exploration of wealth accumulation and distribution at times borders on the polemic but will nonetheless provide food for thought and fuel for discussion.<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></b></p><h2>A Precautionary Tale: How One Small Town Banned Pesticides, Preserved Its Food Heritage, and Inspired a Movement</h2><p><p>Mals, Italy, has long been known as the breadbasket of the Tyrol. But recently the tiny town became known for something else entirely. <em>A Precautionary Tale</em> tells us why, introducing readers to an unlikely group of activists and a forward-thinking mayor who came together to ban pesticides in Mals by a referendum vote&#x2015;making it the first place on Earth to accomplish such a feat, and a model for other towns and regions to follow.<br> <br> For hundreds of years, the people of Mals had cherished their traditional foodways and kept their local agriculture organic. Their town had become a mecca for tourists drawn by the alpine landscape, the rural and historic character of the villages, and the fine breads, wines, cheeses, herbs, vegetables, and the other traditional foods they produced. Yet Mals is located high up in the eastern Alps, and the valley below was being steadily overtaken by big apple producers, heavily dependent on pesticides. As Big Apple crept further and further up the region&#x2019;s mountainsides, their toxic spray drifted with the valley&#x2019;s ever-present winds and began to fall on the farms and fields of Mals&#x2015;threatening their organic certifications, as well as their health and that of their livestock.&nbsp;<br> <br> The advancing threats gradually motivated a diverse cast of characters to take action&#x2015;each in their own unique way, and then in concert in an iconic display of direct democracy in action. As Ackerman-Leist recounts their uprising, we meet an organic dairy farmer who decides to speak up when his hay is poisoned by drift; a pediatrician who engaged other medical professionals to protect the soil, water, and air that the health of her patients depends upon; a hairdresser whose salon conversations mobilized the town&#x2019;s women in an extraordinarily conceived campaign; and others who together orchestrated one of the rare revolutionary successes of our time and inspired a movement now snaking its way through Europe and the United States.<br> <br> A foreword by Vandana Shiva calls upon others to follow in Mals&#x2019;s footsteps.</p></p><p><p>Philip Ackerman-Leist, author of <em>Rebuilding the Foodshed</em> and <em>Up Tunket Road</em>, is a professor at Green Mountain College, where he established the college&#x2019;s farm and sustainable agriculture curriculum, directs its Farm &amp; Food Project, and founded its Master of Science in Sustainable Food Systems, the nation&#x2019;s first online graduate program in food systems, featuring applied comparative research of students&#x2019; home bioregions. He and his wife, Erin, farmed in the South Tyrol region of the Alps and North Carolina before beginning their nineteen-year homesteading and farming venture in Pawlet, Vermont. With more than two decades of field experience working on farms, in the classroom, and with regional food systems collaborators, Philip&#x2019;s work is focused on examining and reshaping local and regional food systems from the ground up.</p><p><strong><em>Booklist</em>&#x2015;</strong></p> <p>"Northern Italy&#x2019;s South Tyrol province is at a cultural crossroads where the Swiss, Austrians, and Italians have all claimed the region&#x2019;s fertile slopes. The latest struggle for the area is agricultural, pitting organic farmers against Big Apple, the opposition&#x2019;s nickname for a cooperative of fruit growers who spray pesticides on their high-tech orchards up to 20 times per year. Due to frequent winds, Big Apple&#x2019;s pesticides drift into the adjacent organic fields, harming the income and reputation of farmers who pledged to be chemical-free. Thanks to its remoteness, Mals, a municipality in South Tyrol, has been out of Big Apple&#x2019;s reach, but the construction of industrial orchards is approaching. This is the story of Mals and its successful, preemptive campaign to ban pesticides within the township borders. With profiles of organic farmers, descriptions of traditional foods, and accounts of creative local politics, the book will appeal to readers who enjoy reading encouraging stories of grassroots environmental action. A short 'activist&#x2019;s primer' is included."&nbsp;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Publishers Weekl</em>y&#x2015;</strong></p> <p>"In this down-to-earth volume on the effects of pesticides, Ackerman-Leist (<em>Rebuilding the Foodshed</em>), a farmer and professor at Green Mountain College, chronicles the agricultural battles waged in Mals, a town in the Italian Alps filling fast with apple orchards. Residents had grown accustomed to the 'gradual march of the orchards up the slopes' but were dismayed by the 'enveloping mists blasted from the spray machines mounted on the back of the advancing tractors.' Ackerman-Leist profiles some of the crucial actors in Mals&#x2019;s fight against 'Big Apple,' during which the residents of Mals passed a referendum vote to ban pesticides. He introduces G�nther Walln�fer, an organic dairy farmer whose family business sat adjacent to a new orchard; residue from the orchard&#x2019;s chemical sprays had found its way to Walln�fer&#x2019;s livestock. Ackerman-Leist also talks with Peter Gasser, a veterinarian who interacted daily with farmers and livestock. As a result of this work Gasser had a thorough knowledge of the community&#x2019;s issues, which he would later use to help lead the fight against pesticides in the town. Ackerman-Leist argues that Mals&#x2019;s story has particular relevance for American farmers who face similar circumstances, and he concludes his discussion with useful suggestions for farming communities on topics such as information gathering and political engagement.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Foreword Reviews-</em></strong></p> <p>"Focusing on a region of the Alps where farming has been a mainstay for millennia, this book examines a successful grassroots movement to ban pesticides.... <em>A Precautionary Tale&nbsp;</em>is an optimistic read with an enthusiastic and celebratory tone.

Indeed, they have managed to defeat giant corporations.&nbsp;And they remind us that we can&#x2019;t let despair or sadness&nbsp;paralyze&nbsp;us, that we can trust the strength of community, and that we must do our part and act.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Perrine and Charles Herv�-Gruyer, authors of <em>Miraculous Abundance</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Many, many thanks to Philip Ackerman-Leist for telling us the wonderful story of Mals, the town in Italy that decided to ban the use of pesticides!

However, it taught me two very important things about Thanksgiving entertaining: First, less is more, something you never hear when it comes to Thanksgiving. Second, Thanksgiving should be spent with family, friends, or loved ones, not with a caterer. If you cringe thinking about a long, drawn-�out meal with heated family discussions around the dinner table, then a Cocktail Party Thanksgiving is perfect for you, since there&#x2019;s no dining room table required for it. If this concept scares you completely and entertaining without sitting at a table just will not cut it for your Thanksgiving gathering, then use this party as a fun night of thanks with your pals, pre-�Thanksgiving recipe testing, or a gratitude party. While these recipes and ideas are great for Thanksgiving, they can also serve as a template for all your fall cocktail parties. Good luck, and gobble gobble!<br><br> Love,<br><br> Mary<br><br> PS: If you&#x2019;re scared to try my Turkey with Mini Pumpkin Muffins that were featured in People magazine (how&#x2019;s that for a shameless plug?) Don&#x2019;t sweat it. Take the pressure off yourself and relish the comfort of knowing that in addition to it being a day of gratitude, it is also a day where disastrous entertaining mistakes are being made throughout the country. So roll up those sleeves and get baking.<br><br> Turkey with Cranberry on Mini Pumpkin Muffins<br><br> These muffins are a great way to use up leftover turkey or celebrate the flavors of Thanksgiving any time of year. You can also spice them up by using a jalape�o-cranberry sauce for a little kick.

The true hallmark of great literature is great imagination, and as Neil Gaiman and Al Sarrantonio prove with this outstanding collection, when it comes to great fiction, all genres are equal. </p> <p><i>Stories</i> is a groundbreaking anthology that reinvigorates, expands, and redefines the limits of imaginative fiction and affords some of the best writers in the world&#x2014;from Peter Straub and Chuck Palahniuk to Roddy Doyle and Diana Wynne Jones, Stewart O'Nan and Joyce Carol Oates to Walter Mosley and Jodi Picoult&#x2014;the opportunity to work together, defend their craft, and realign misconceptions. Gaiman, a literary magician whose acclaimed work defies easy categorization and transcends all boundaries, and "master anthologist" (<i>Booklist</i>) Sarrantonio personally invited, read, and selected all the stories in this collection, and their standard for this "new literature of the imagination" is high. "We wanted to read stories that used a lightning-flash of magic as a way of showing us something we have already seen a thousand times as if we have never seen it at all." </p> <p>Joe Hill boldly aligns theme and form in his disturbing tale of a man's descent into evil in "Devil on the Staircase." In "Catch and Release," Lawrence Block tells of a seasoned fisherman with a talent for catching a bite of another sort. Carolyn Parkhurst adds a dark twist to sibling rivalry in "Unwell." Joanne Harris weaves a tale of ancient gods in modern New York in "Wildfire in Manhattan." Vengeance is the heart of Richard Adams's "The Knife."

From the impassioned slide guitar of the Mississippi Delta, to the electric sounds of Chicago's street corners, to the improvised jams of blues- rock, <i>The Blues</i> explores the many forms this quintessentially American music has taken. All the great pioneers are here, including Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Bessie Smith, and John Lee Hooker, along with the many musicians they influenced who put their own unique spin on the genre. <br>&nbsp;<br>As well as tracing the evolution of the blues through its various styles, this musical journey features profiles of no fewer than fifty key artists&#x2014;including fact files with biographical information, recording histories and more.</p><p>Mike Evans, a London-based author with a background as a musician, began to write about music in the 1970s for such publications as <i>Sounds</i>, <i>Creem</i>, and <i>Melody Maker</i>. He has since gone on to write the bestselling <i>Elvis: A Celebration</i> (DK Adult) and Sterling's own <i>Woodstock: Three Days That Shook the World</i>. &nbsp;Born in Memphis, consulting editor Robert Gordon is one of the world's most highly respected blues historians. His books include <i>The King on the Road</i> (produced in cooperation with the Elvis Presley Estate at Graceland), the acclaimed biography <i>Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters</i> (Back Bay Books), and the classic study of Memphis music <i>It Came from Memphis</i> (Atria Books).&#x201c;Thousands of books have been written about the blues. There have been many photographic essays over the years but there hasn&#x2019;t been one as comprehensive and as attractively designed and produced as this one in a very long time. Newcomers to the music will benefit from the eight well-�written and informative chapters covering the 'Roots of the Blues' up to 'The Blues Today.' Making this book really special are the layout and the more than 350 photographs (color and black and white), both large and small, that document the societal happenings of each of the periods discussed, the top performers, the album labels, the concert posters, and so on. The book and cover design by Paul Palmer-Edwards, of Grade Design, London, gets high marks indeed. Author Evans (a musician) has been writing about music for over 40 years (<i>Elvis: A Celebration</i>; <i>Woodstock: Three Days That Shook the World</i>) and has done an admirable job of analyzing such a long and varied history in an entertaining yet educational way. Thus, this title is that rare combination, a sumptuous coffee-table book that is worth reading as well. <b>VERDICT</b> Highly recommended for all blues collections.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Library Journal</i> (Starred Review)</p><h2>The Sky Is Falling: A Novel</h2><p>The Sky Is Falling<p></p><blockquote>A spellbinding novel of glamour, sex, power,and murder that spans the globe</blockquote><p>If America had a royal family, the Winthrops would wear the crown. The popular, charismatic Winthrops have captured the imagination of the world with their public service, their enormous charity, and their glamorous lives. But in a single year, all five members of the family are killed in a series of accidents.</p><p>Dana Evans, a beautiful young anchorwoman with a Washington television network, believes there is something more sinister behind their deaths. She begins an investigation and starts uncovering compelling evidence that she can hardly believe.</p><p>In her determined pursuit of the truth, Dana never anticipated the cat-and-mouse chase that leads her through a half-dozen countries in search of a remorseless killer.

But that doesn't keep Dana from following a story all over the world, from Washington to Aspen, Nice, Juneau, Dusseldorf, Rome, Brussels, Moscow, and Siberia. Each of these brief visits is like a postcard--a local landmark or two, an interesting local restaurant (at least in the European venues), and another piece of the puzzle, which has to do with why every member of a venerable, old Washington dynasty has died a violent death in the last year. It seems strange that in a media-savvy city like Washington, no one but Dana has noticed there's a pattern in the rapid extinction of the Winthrops or even whispered the words <i>family vendetta</i>. But that's why pretty, young girl TV reporters were invented, at least by Sheldon. <p> As Dana sets out to investigate the distinguished career of the Winthrop family patriarch, her lover Jeff, a sports anchor at her station, is called away to administer aid and succor to his former wife, a beautiful model who's realized, too little and too late, that she never should have dumped him. And Kemal, the 12-year-old orphan, is being drugged by his baby sitter, who's in cahoots with at least one set of bad guys. Dana hasn't noticed how tractable the temperamental boy has become recently because she's been dressing up like a two-bit Russian tramp to infiltrate a secret weapons base in Siberia... Do you hear the words <i>movie locations</i>? But all's well that ends well, as it usually does for Sheldon's heroines, and in the meantime you've learned where the five-star hotels are and what to order in a famous restaurant in Rome. A slick, commercial, slightly thin tale told by a craftsman of the genre. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><p>The late novelist and screenwriter Sidney Sheldon remains one of the world's top bestselling authors, having sold more than 300 million copies of his books. <em>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</em> is his most recent in a long line of huge bestsellers.

Others say political savvy or family background or regional influences are paramount. But Don Van Natta Jr., an award-winning <i>New York Times</i> reporter, argues for another, more light-hearted standard--by observing the way they play golf. Fourteen of the last seventeen presidents have been golfers, and <i>First Off the Tee</i> shows why this sport is so much more than a game for them. <p> Recounting some of the most entertaining yet little-told stories of the American presidency, Van Natta seeks to answer two questions: Why is the game of golf so attractive to the men who occupy the Oval Office? And what do their golf games reveal about their characters? Some presidents relied on golf to escape the burdens of office, while others brought those burdens with them. And few have been able to resist the perks of high office, bending the rules and freely taking mulligans. Each president also brought his own personality to bear on his golf game: </p><p> John F. Kennedy often sneaked out of the White House to play golf on the sly, because he didn't want anyone to think he was as golf-obsessed as his predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower. But he was. </p><p> Woodrow Wilson played golf every morning, because his doctor told him he needed the exercise. Little did he know that through golf he would meet and court the woman who would become his wife. </p><p> Gerald Ford's first public appearance after pardoning Richard Nixon was at the opening of the World Golf Hall of Fame, where he played with Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player, and hit the best tee shot of his presidency. </p><p> Franklin Roosevelt fell in love with the game while still in prep school, helping to found a golf club at age seventeen and bringing his clubs with him to Harvard. It was a love that was tragically cut short. "After he was stricken with polio," Eleanor Roosevelt recalled, "the one word that he never said again was golf." </p><p> And is it surprising at all to learn that the section of this book called "Hail to the Cheats" features the golfing escapades of Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, and Warren Harding? For these chief executives, being president meant never having to say double-bogey. </p><p> Not content to rely solely on the history books, Don Van Natta also takes the reader on an eye-opening round of golf he recently played with Bill Clinton and explores how the strong father-son bond between the two George Bushes comes into its sharpest focus on the links. He also draws on extensive interviews with the golfing ex-presidents about what the game means to them. For history buffs and golf aficionados alike, <i>First Off the Tee</i> is a cheerful romp and a unique way to share the links with America's duffers-in-chief. </p><p></p>"<i>First Off the Tee</i> is an intelligent, lively and richly entertaining excursion that shows us the surprising things we can learn about presidents by scrutinizing their behavior on the golf course." --Michael Beschloss <p> "Thanks to Don Van Natta, history must now be revised to document the insidious influence of golf on the American presidency, and vice versa. What a kinder, gentler nation we might be today if Richard Nixon had been able to break 80 honestly, just once." --Carl Hiaasen </p><p> "Don Van Natta Jr. has managed to morph my two favorite subjects--golf and president-watching--into a marvelously funny, wickedly delightful book. <i>First Off the Tee</i> makes it clear that any president who rejects golf will be condemned to a single term in the White House. It's gratifying to learn that when it came to golf JFK and Ike never cheated. Nixon and Clinton . . . well, that's another story. A great read." --Douglas Brinkley </p><p> "What could be more complimentary to the great game of golf than to know how much it has intertwined the recreational lives of so many of our nation's presidents and provided them with occasional moments of relaxation and enjoyment amid the overwhelming demands of that highest of offices. Don Van Natta's chronicle of the exploits of our golfing presidents provides most interesting reading and adds measurably to the written history of the game." --Arnold Palmer </p><p> "This is a wonderful laugh-out-loud book about golfing presidents and presidents golfing that shows that on the greens they're just like the rest of us-only more so." --Richard Reeves</p></p><h2>The Light in the Ruins</h2><p>From the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Midwives</i> and <i>The Sandcastle Girls</i> comes a spellbinding novel of love, despair, and revenge&#x2014;set in war-ravaged Tuscany.<br><br> 1943: Tucked away in the idyllic hills south of Florence, the Rosatis, an Italian family of noble lineage, believe that the walls of their ancient villa will keep them safe from the war raging across Europe.

It is, at least according to the police report, somewhere between midnight and three in the morning, on the first Tuesday of June 1955. For dinner she ate a small portion of an impossibly rich pasta&#x2014;a fettuccini with pecorino cheese and great ladles of truffle oil&#x2014;at a restaurant popular with wealthy American and British expatriates five blocks west of the Uffizi and a block north of the Arno. She was one of the few Italians there who wasn&#x2019;t part of the kitchen or wait staff. She has since bathed, soaping off both her own perfume and the cologne that was worn by her dinner companion&#x2014;the fellow who had come back here to the apartment, made love with her on the thin bed no more than three feet from the vanity, and then left. He was a suspect in the murder investigation, but only briefly. If he had had even the slightest inclination to spend the evening, there is every chance that I would have executed him that night, too.<br><br> At the moment she is wearing her nightgown (which is not especially revealing), though at some point very soon it will be cut off her. Yes, cut. Not even pulled over her head. Sliced from the opening at her collarbone down to the hem, which, when she stands, is mid-shin. By then, of course, she will be dead. Bleeding out. I will have sliced open her neck from one side of her jaw to the other.<br><br>Just so you know, that art nouveau vanity is not particularly valuable. The white paint is chipped, and two of the whiplike finials along the right side broke off years ago. Before the war. Moreover, her nightgown is cotton, and the material has started to pill. I mention this so you are not envisioning this room as more glamorous than it is. The woman is still beautiful, even now in middle age and despite the horrific, seemingly unbearable losses she endured a decade ago, in the last year of the war. These days she lives in a neighborhood of Florence that is solidly working- class, a section the tourists visit only when they are impressively, almost hopelessly lost. A decade ago, she would not have known a neighborhood like this even existed.<br><br>The apartment has neither a doorman nor a primitive intercom connecting the wrought iron and frosted glass street door with her modest unit. It is locked, but not all that difficult to open. (Really, it wasn&#x2019;t.) According to the police report, at some point in that roughly three-hour window in the early hours of that first Tuesday in June, I used a blunt object (the handle of my knife, as a matter of fact) to break a pane of the glass near the doorknob. Then I reached in, turned the lock, and opened the door. Remember, this is an unassuming little building. Then I moved silently up the stairway to the third fl oor, where she lived, and knocked on her door. She rose from the vanity, her brush still in her hand, and paused for a moment on her side of the wood.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;<br><br>And here I lied. I said I was her dinner companion, speaking into my gloved hand to muffle my voice.<br><br>So she opened the door and would be dead within moments.<br><br>And why did I slice open her nightgown? I didn&#x2019;t violate her. It was so I could cut out her heart. A woman with the lilting name of Francesca Rosati, who had once been a Tuscan marchese&#x2019;s daughter-in-law, was my first.<br><br>But, as you will see, not my last.</i><br> 1943<br> The planes flew in great flocks that May over the Crete Senesi, the lunarlike landscape that marked the Tuscan countryside southeast of Siena. By night the planes were British or American bombers and their destination was Bologna. By day they were German, long streams of Junkers, and their destination was either Sicily or Naples. After that they would attempt to reach Tunisia and reinforce the Axis troops there, but most&#x2014;and Cristina Rosati knew this from the BBC, not from her own country&#x2019;s newspapers&#x2014;would be shot down and crash into the Mediterranean Sea. The Italians and Germans in North Africa were finished, and there was absolutely no chance of evacuating them; the army might as well have been on the moon. Sometimes Cristina wished that her brothers were in Tunisia so they might be captured by the Allies and sent to England, where they could await the end of the war in the safety of a prisoner-of-war camp. Instead, Marco was in Sicily, preparing the beaches there for the anticipated Allied invasion. He was an engineer. Vittore, an archeologist, was safe in Florence, but there was bombastic talk on the radio and in the newspapers about the need for total war, and no one in her family would have been surprised if he were suddenly given a rifl e and sent off to Sardinia or Greece or some battery along the coast. Both of her brothers were older than she was; barely eighteen, Cristina was the baby of the three Rosati children.<br><br>For a long moment she stood outside on the villa&#x2019;s southern terrace and watched the planes, the dark fuselage of each aircraft gleaming in the sun. She was holding four cloth dolls that belonged to her young niece, as well as the scraps of red and gold&nbsp; napkins from which she was crafting Renaissance dresses for the two princesses and tunics for the two men&#x2014;neither of whom, according to the little girl, was a prince. Cristina had been playing with the child on the terrace when the girl&#x2019;s mother had informed them that it was nap time and herded the child and her brother&#x2014;who at that moment had been running like a madman along the edge of the swimming pool, using a thin beech branch as a saber&#x2014;upstairs to the nursery.<br><br>And so Cristina was alone when the planes droned southward, high above the Villa Chimera. She was fascinated by them, held almost spellbound. Someday, when the world once again was at peace, she would fl y somewhere in an airplane. To Pisa,&nbsp;maybe. Or Naples. Or perhaps all the way to Paris. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine anything more glamorous.<br><br>Now a pair of small lizards raced past her, faster than snakes, darting just beyond her toes into the lilacs that grew along the edge of the loggia. Nearby she heard the bells on the sheep and, farther away, the low thrum of a distant tractor. She thought she heard one of the estate&#x2019;s horses whinny. Arabella, most likely. <br><br>Finally, when the planes had disappeared far to the south, she ventured inside. Her sister- in- law appeared almost at the same moment, tiptoeing down the stairs so she wouldn&#x2019;t disturb her children. She was shaking her head.<br><br>&#x201c;The planes are starting to scare Massimo,&#x201d; Francesca said. Massimo was seven, old enough to understand the connection between the planes and the dangers his father might soon face in Sicily. He&#x2019;d overheard the conversations of the more injudicious grown- ups about where the Allies would strike when they had finished with Africa. And then there was all the talk of the bombing in Genoa and Turin, and the possibility that their family might take in urban children whose homes had been destroyed by the Allied air attacks.<br><br>&#x201c;And Alessia?&#x201d; Cristina asked. Her niece was five and utterly fearless.<br><br>Francesca shrugged and poured herself a glass of iced tea. &#x201c;Oblivious. The world is a game to that child. Fortunately.&#x201d; Then she sat down and stretched out her long legs before her. She, too, was barefoot, but somewhere she had found a bottle of polish and painted her toenails red. She was wearing one of the elegant floral skirts she had purchased when they had been in Florence just before Christmas. It was inappropriate here in the country in the middle of the afternoon, but it swayed like a ballerina&#x2019;s when she moved, and Francesca wasn&#x2019;t made for a world of scarcity or sacrifice. She was nine years older than Cristina, twenty-seven now, and had always seemed to her younger sister-in-law to embody the chic that Cristina had glimpsed in her visits to Rome or Milan or, more frequently, Florence. Francesca dyed her hair the color of honey and clearly had no intention of allowing herself to grow round while her husband was in Sicily and she was here alone with the children.<br><br>&#x201c;I hate airplanes,&#x201d; she added after a moment. &#x201c;No good has come from an airplane. Ever. You realize that, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>Cristina smiled. Francesca was fond of great, sweeping pronouncements. &#x201c;You know that&#x2019;s not true.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know nothing of the sort,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I saw you from the window. You were watching the planes. Someday you&#x2019;ll be looking up and they&#x2019;ll be bombing you. Us. The estate. You watch. Someday the bombs will be falling on our heads.&#x201d;<br><br>Outside, they heard a car winding its way up the gravel road that led to the villa, and Cristina wandered to the dining room window. The automobile was a long, black army staff car. No doubt people had been talking as the vehicle had wound its way through the narrow streets of the village, past the hulking medieval granary, and then up the hill to the estate. She watched as the young driver, a private, hopped out and opened the rear door for the two officers, one German and one Italian. She didn&#x2019;t recognize either of them and felt a pang of anxiety. They couldn&#x2019;t possibly be bringing good news, she thought, but nevertheless she tried to reassure herself. The closest her brother Vittore ever came to danger were his arguments with the Germans when they wanted to steal some treasure in Arezzo or Florence and take it to Germany&#x2014;and those disputes, he insisted, were civilized. The Germans would ask and he would say no. They would grow more adamant and he would explain why the painting or statue or vase could not be moved. And then they would either ignore him completely and loot the artifact anyway or&#x2014;for reasons that were inexplicable to Vittore but he guessed had everything to do with whether the Germans had already promised the piece of art to a spouse or mistress or a more senior officer&#x2014;back down and choose a less valuable item from the collection. <br><br>But if they were not here about Vittore, did that mean that something horrific had happened to Marco? She tried to convince herself that this wasn&#x2019;t likely either. Francesca&#x2019;s husband was in Sicily, and there was no fighting there. Still, he was a soldier&#x2014;a captain&#x2014;as well as an engineer, and the idea that he might be wounded or dead caused her to feel a wave of nausea, and she placed her palms fl at on the stucco windowsill for balance. She told herself that she was overreacting; this had to be something else. Why would the army dispatch two officers to inform the family that an engineer was dead on a Sicilian beach or an archeologist had died at his post in a . . . a museum? Didn&#x2019;t they send telegrams?<br><br>She felt Francesca breathing behind her. &#x201c;Do you know them?&#x201d; Cristina asked her sister-in-law.<br><br>Francesca shook her head. &#x201c;Why would I know some thug and his sorry little sidekick?&#x201d;<br><br>The driver was standing beside his vehicle, but the officers were approaching the villa. The German outranked the Italian but looked a decade younger: midthirties, Cristina guessed. Maybe thirty- five. The Italian had his dark hair pomaded almost flat on his head and a thin mustache he had waxed into a pair of curls. His cheekbones were sharp; he was a handsome man. The German was two or three inches taller, his hair the washed- out color of the wheat fields in August. He was carrying a sidearm; the Italian was not.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to want something, you know,&#x201d; her sister-in-law added. &#x201c;The barbarians are here to commandeer something. One of the cars, maybe. Or a truck. Maybe they&#x2019;re after the sheep.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I hope that&#x2019;s all it is,&#x201d; Cristina murmured.<br><br>With one hand Francesca briefly rubbed her sister-in-law&#x2019;s back and shoulders and reassured her: &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to worry about the boys. I am sure this is another annoyance. Not a new tragedy.&#x201d;<br><br>The front door was open to catch whatever breezes might come in from the west, but the officers hovered in the entryway, their caps in their hands. Francesca beckoned them into the foyer, a wide and airy room itself, with a long fl at window and shelves of Etruscan vases, amphoras, and kraters&#x2014;some replicas and some original, but so common that the museums hadn&#x2019;t a use for them. &#x201c;My children are sleeping, so you&#x2019;ll have to speak softly,&#x201d; Francesca said, her way of greeting the two men.<br><br>The Italian nodded. &#x201c;I am Major Lorenzetti. This is Colonel Decher.&#x201d; He glanced into the kitchen and the dining room and continued, &#x201c;Your home is as lovely as I&#x2019;d heard. I presume you two are the marchese&#x2019;s daughters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am the marchese&#x2019;s daughter-in-law,&#x201d; Francesca corrected him, emphasizing her father-in-law&#x2019;s title in a fashion that conveyed how absurd she thought it was.&nbsp;Francesca believed that the very notion of dukes and princes and counts in the middle part of the twentieth century was ridiculous. She found it a source of unending wonder that her people were ruled by a dictator and a puppet king and her father- in- law owned a small fiefdom. Cristina knew that Francesca was fundamentally apolitical, but when pressed to claim an affiliation with any political structure or school of thought, the woman would express a vague predisposition toward the Hollywood star system in America, because studio heads and movie stars dressed well, made art, and left her alone. &#x201c;This,&#x201d; she continued now, motioning toward Cristina, &#x201c;is the marchese&#x2019;s only daughter. My father-in-law has two boys and this one lovely girl.&#x201d;<br><br>The Italian major bowed just the tiniest bit. &#x201c;Of course. I spoke without thinking. You must be Francesca,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And you must be Cristina. Is the marchese home?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He and his wife, the marchesa&#x201d;&#x2014;and here Francesca again briefly paused&#x2014;&#x201c;are down in the olive grove with the overseer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be back soon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s likely.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then we can wait.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you wait quietly. Remember, my children just started to nap.&#x201d;<br><br>The Italian nodded, but the German shook his head and scowled. Cristina worried that her sister-in-law&#x2019;s insolence had gone far enough and jumped in. &#x201c;Please, let&#x2019;s wait for my father on the veranda,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s shady there and you&#x2019;ll be more&nbsp;comfortable. I can bring you some iced tea.&#x201d;<br><br>It was clear, however, that she had already waited too long to try to mollify their guests. In an Italian that was heavily accented with German, Colonel Decher snapped, &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have time to wait, we&#x2019;re due back in Florence. I don&#x2019;t see why you can&#x2019;t show us what we need to see as well as your father could. I understand there was a dig on your property in 1938. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re here. We want to see the necropolis, and given our time constraints, we want to see it now.&#x201d;<br><br>Cristina almost laughed. She had been shivering slightly, and now her whole body relaxed. This visit had nothing to do with either of her brothers. It had nothing to do with the needs of their armies&#x2019; quartermasters. This pair wanted nothing, it seemed, but to see the underground tombs on the far side of the vineyard. The family had come across the burial site when they had expanded the vineyard in 1937 and broken ground for a new shed that would accommodate a larger press and additional barrels. The builders had understood quickly that they had unearthed, literally, a small Etruscan tomb. The first vestiges they discovered? Three columns. Two were mere&nbsp;stumps, but one still towered seven feet high when th...</p><h2>The Religion: A Novel</h2><p><i>This is what we dream of: to be so swept away, so </i>poleaxed<i> by a book that the breath is sucked right out of us. Brace yourselves.</i>&nbsp;May 1565. Suleiman the Magnificent, emperor of the Ottomans, has declared a jihad against the Knights of Saint John the Baptist. The largest armada of all time approaches the knights' Christian stronghold on the island of Malta. The Turks know the knights as the "Hounds of Hell." The knights call themselves "The Religion."&nbsp;In Messina, Sicily, a French countess, Carla La Penautier, seeks passage to Malta in a quest to find the son taken from her at his birth twelve years ago. The only man with the expertise and daring to help her is a Rabelaisian soldier of fortune, arms dealer, former janissary, and strapping Saxon adventurer by the name of Mattias Tannhauser. He agrees to accompany the lady to Malta, where, amid the most spectacular siege in military history, they must try to find the boy--whose name they do not know and whose face they have never seen--and pluck him from the jaws of Holy War.&nbsp;<i>The Religion </i>is the first book of the Tannhauser Trilogy, and from the first page of this epic account of the last great medieval conflict between East and West, it is clear we are in the hands of a master. Not since James Clavell has a novelist so powerfully and assuredly plunged readers headlong into another world and time. Anne Rice transformed the vampire novel. Stephen King reinvented horror. Now, in a spectacular tale of heroism, tragedy, and passion, Tim Willocks revivifies historical fiction.</p><p><b>Tim Willocks&nbsp;</b>is a novelist and filmmaker.

He lives in Ireland.Prologue&nbsp;The Devshirme&nbsp;Spring, A.D. 1540&nbsp;The Fagaras Mountains--East Hungarian Marches&nbsp;On the night the scarlet horsemen took him away--from all he knew and all he might have known--the moon waxed full in Scorpio, sign of his birth, and as if by the hand of God its incandescence split the alpine valley sheer into that which was dark and that which was light, and the light lit the path of devils to his door. If the dogs of war hadn't lost their way, the boy would never have been found, and peace and love and labor might have blessed him all his days. But such is the nature of Fate in a time of Chaos. And when is Time not Chaos? And when is War not a spawnhole of fiends? And who dries the tears of the nameless when even saints and martyrs lie sleeping in their crypts? A king had died and his throne was disputed and emperors fought like jackals to seize the spoils. And if emperors care little for the graveyards they scatter in their wake, why should their servants care more? As above, so below, say the wise men, and so it was that night.&nbsp;His name was Mattias and he was twelve years old and of matters of Policy and State he knew nothing at all. His family were Saxon metalsmiths, transplanted by his migrant grandfather to a steep Carpathian valley and a village of no importance except to those who called it home. He slept by the kitchen hearthstone and dreamed of fire and steel. He awoke in the dark before dawn with his heart a wild bird in his chest. He pulled on boots and a scorch-marked coat and silently--for two sisters and his mother slept next door--he took wood and summoned flames from the pale pink embers in the hearth so that warmth would greet the girls on their rising.&nbsp;Like all firstborn men of his line, Mattias was a blacksmith. His purpose today was to complete the making of a dagger and this filled him with joy, for what boy would not make real weapons if he could? From the hearth he took a burning brand and stole into the yard and the sharp air filled his chest and he stopped. The world about was painted black and silver by the moon. Above the mountain's rimrock, constellations wheeled in their sphere and he sought out their shapes and marked them under his breath. Virgo, Bootes, Cassiopeia. Lower down the slopes headlong streaks of brightness marked the valley's forked stream, and pastures floated misty beneath the woodlands. In the yard, his father's forge stood like a temple to some prophet unknown and the firelight on its pale stone walls promised magic and marvels, and the doing of Things that no one had done before.&nbsp;As his father, Kristofer, had taught him, Mattias crossed himself on the threshold and whispered a prayer to Saint James. Kristofer was out on the road, shoeing and sharpening tools for the farms and manors thereabouts. Would he be angry, when he returned, that Mattias had wasted three days' forging? When he might have made fishhooks or a wood saw or a scythe--goods that always found a ready buyer? No, not if the blade were true. If the blade were true, his father would be proud. Mattias crossed himself and stepped inside.&nbsp;The forge smelled of ox hooves and sea salt, of clinker, horses, and coal. The firepot was readied as he'd left it the evening before and the kindling caught with the firebrand's first touch. He worked the bellows and fed yesterday's coke to the flames, coaxing the fire, building it, until burning charcoal lay two inches deep on the tuyere. He lit the lamp, then unearthed his blade from the ashes in which he'd buried it overnight.&nbsp;He'd taken two days to straighten and harden the steel, six inches in the blade and four in the tang. Knives he'd made before but this was his first dagger, and the requisite skill was multiplied in the weapon's double-edged symmetry and the forging of strength in the spine. He hadn't perfected the symmetry but the edges didn't roll beneath a file. He blew away the ash and sighted down the bevels and found no warp or screw. With a damp rag he wiped the blade clean and worked its either surface smooth with pumice. Then he polished the blade until it gleamed dark blue, with powder of Emril and butter. Now would his Art be tested in the temper.&nbsp;On the charcoal bed he laid a quarter inch of ash, and on the ash the blade, and watched the color creep through the steel, turning it face over face so the heat remained even. When the cutting edges glowed as pale as fresh straw, he pulled the blade clear with the tongs and plunged it into a bucket of damp soil. Burning vapors spiraled with a smell that made him heady. In this first quench, by his grandfather's lore, the blade laid claim at its birth to the power of all four elements: earth, fire, water, and air. Such a blade would endure. He rebuilt the coal bed and layered the ashes on top, and took the lid from his second quench, a bucket of horse piss. He'd collected it the day before, from the fleetest horse in the village.&nbsp;"Can I watch, Mattie?"&nbsp;For a moment his sister's voice vexed him. This was his work, his place, a man's place, not a place for a five-year-old girl. But Britta adored him. He always saw her eyes glow when she looked at him. She was the baby of the family. The death of two younger brothers before they could walk remained at the back of Mattias's mind, or rather, not their deaths but the memory of his mother's grief and his father's silent anguish. By the time he turned, his anger was gone, and he smiled to see Britta in the doorway, her silhouette doll-like in the first gray rumor of dawn. She wore a nightshirt and clogs and she clenched her hands about reedy arms as she shivered. Mattias took off his coat as he walked over and slipped it around her shoulders. He picked her up and sat her on the sacks of salt inside the door.&nbsp;"You can watch from here, as long as you stay back from the fire." The bargain wasn't ideal, he could see, but she didn't demur. "Are Mamma and Gerta still sleeping?" he asked.&nbsp;Britta nodded. "Yes. But the village dogs are barking. I was scared."&nbsp;Mattias cocked an ear. It was true. From down the hill came a chorus of yaps and snarls. Absorbed by the crackle of the forge he hadn't noticed.&nbsp;"They must have found a fox," he said.&nbsp;"Or a wolf."&nbsp;He smiled. "The wolves don't come here anymore."&nbsp;He returned to his blade and found it cool enough to touch. He wiped it clean and laid it once more on the fire. He was tempted to pump the bellows, for he loved the surge of life within the coals, but if the color rose too fast the core of the steel might weaken, and he resisted.&nbsp;"Why don't the wolves come here anymore?"&nbsp;Mattias flipped the blade. "Because they're afraid of us."&nbsp;"Why are the wolves afraid of us?"&nbsp;The edges flushed dark fawn, like a deer's coat in autumn, and he grabbed the blade with the tongs and flipped it again, and yes, the color was even and rising still, with magentas in the spine and tang, and the second quench was upon him. He pulled the blade from the forge and plunged it into the urine. The hiss was explosive and he turned his face from the acrid ammoniac steam. He began at once to say an Ave. Halfway through, Britta joined in, stumbling over the Latin, and he continued without waiting, timing the quench by the pace of the prayer until he'd finished, then he pulled the smoking steel from the caustic brew and buried it down in the ash box and wiped his brow.&nbsp;The second temper was done, he hoped well enough. The pungent bite of the piss quench would impart itself to the metal and keep its sharpness keen. Perhaps too, he hoped, the fleetness of the horse would quicken the dagger to its mark. For the third quench, most magical of all, he would take the glowing blade out to the dense green grass by the vegetable patch, and temper it with the newly fallen dew. No waters were more pure, for no one had ever seen them fall, even if they stayed wakeful through the night, and they flowed from Heaven. Some believed them the tears God shed for His children while they slept. Through such cooling dew the spirit of the mountain would bind to the dagger's heart and its purpose would always be true. He pushed a pair of tempering tongs into the coals and pumped the fire until the thickened ends glowed orange.&nbsp;"Mattie, why are the wolves afraid of us?"&nbsp;"Because they fear we will hunt them and kill them."&nbsp;"Why would we hunt and kill them?"&nbsp;"Because they kill our sheep. And because their skins are warm against the winter. That's why Dadda wears a wolfskin."&nbsp;"Did Dadda kill the wolf?"&nbsp;Kristofer had indeed, but the story was not for a little girl's ears. Mattias wiped ashes from the blade and laid it by the fire. Britta was not to be ignored, he knew, but the blade was where his attention was needed most. He said, "Why don't you sing me a song? Then the song will be part of the steel, and so will you, and it will be your blade as well as mine."&nbsp;"Which song? Quickly, Mattie, which song?"&nbsp;He glanced at her face and saw her flushed with delight and for a moment he wondered if he had not doomed the blade to be hers forever, at least in her mind.&nbsp;"'The Raven,'" he said.&nbsp;It was a song their mother sang for them and Britta had caused much amazement when, at the age of only three, she had piped her way through every verse. It told of a prince bewitched into a raven by a jealous stepmother, and of the pri...</p><h2>From the Good Mountain: How Gutenberg Changed the World</h2><p><p>What was made of rags and bones, soot and seeds? What took a mountain to make? </p><p>For the answer, travel back to the fifteenth century&#x2015;to a time when books were made by hand and a man named Johannes Gutenberg invented a way to print books with movable type. </p><p>Written as a series of riddles and illustrated in the style of medieval manuscripts by an award-winning author and artist, <i>From the Good Mountain </i>will intrigue readers of all ages. On every page there is something surprising to learn about how the very thing you are holding in your hands came to be.</p></p><p>As a papermaker, letterpress printer, and binder, James Rumford brings to this most recent book not only his love of the printed book but also his knowledge of a craft fast disappearing. James lives in Honolulu with his wife Carol, where he runs Manoa Press, which makes handmade books. <i>From the Good Mountain</i> is his third book for Roaring Brook Press.Gr 5-8-While technically a biography, this beautifully illustrated title is also a history of the early printed book. Through a series of riddles, Rumford explains and illustrates the materials and process Gutenberg used to create the first printed book. By describing the creation of each material used (paper, ink, colored pigments, leather, metal type, etc.), he shows just how difficult it was. The author packs in a great deal of information regarding bookmaking, illuminated manuscripts, and paper craft, but the detail is not overwhelming. The meticulous pen-and-ink drawings are colored with watercolor and gouache and clearly demonstrate (sometimes humorously) the processes described in the text. After describing the materials, Rumford walks readers through the (then) revolutionary process of using a printing press. The author's passion for early bookmaking shines through in the writing. In the epilogue, he explains how little is known of Gutenberg's life and quickly summarizes the printing process since the 1450s. He also poses a question about what future books will look like. A nontraditional keyword list invites readers to do Internet searches to find out more information. This book truly is a labor of love-it took the author more than two years to write and illustrate. For public library collections, this will take some (very worthwhile) hand-selling. It would be a beautiful addition to social-studies units about medieval Europe, inventions, and even literacy.-Lisa Crandall, Capital Area District Library, Holt, MI&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Douglas Egerton illuminates the complex motivations that underlay two related Virginia slave revolts: the first, in 1800, led by the slave known as Gabriel; and the second, called the 'Easter Plot,' instigated in 1802 by one of his followers. Although Gabriel has frequently been portrayed as a messianic, Samson-like figure, Egerton shows that he was a literate and highly skilled blacksmith whose primary goal was to destroy the economic hegemony of the 'merchants,' the only whites he ever identified as his enemies. According to Egerton, the social, political, and economic disorder of the Revolutionary era weakened some of the harsh controls that held slavery in place during colonial times. Emboldened by these conditions, a small number of literate slaves--most of them highly skilled artisans--planned an armed insurrection aimed at destroying slavery in Virginia. The intricate scheme failed, as did the Easter Plot that stemmed from it, and Gabriel and many of his followers were hanged. By placing the revolts within the broader context of the volatile political currents of the day, Egerton challenges the conventional understanding of race, class, and politics in the early days of the American republic.<br><br></p><p>"Well written and meticulously documented, the account of these two abortive revolutions will hold the interest of students and lay readers alike."-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br>Douglas R.

It is caused by infection and can be treated, but 7 million people have been stricken blind by trachoma. An additional 500 million, usually the poorest and most forgotten in communities that are already struggling for survival, are at risk. In African countries, these are often areas where lymphatic filariasis, Guinea worm, schistosomiasis, and onchocerciasis are also endemic.</p><p>I knew about cases of trachoma as a boy, and I often had conjunctivitis, or sore eyes. As is the case now in our targeted areas of Africa, flies were everywhere, breeding in the excrement from both animals and humans. Our barn lot was nearby, and chickens, ducks, and geese ran freely in the yard. Screened doors and windows helped, but we also had to put a piece of gauze on top of any open pot or pitcher to keep the fl ies out of our milk or food. Fortunately, my mother was a nurse and a stickler for cleanliness, and our family had the only outdoor privy in the community. Trachoma was considered a threat to America in those early years, so doctors at Ellis Island used buttonhooks to examine the undersides of immigrants' eyelids and shipped those with trachoma back to their home countries.</p><p>Trachoma is caused by fi lthy and infected eyes, beginning as conjunctivitis and ultimately causing the upper eyelids to turn inward. Every blink drags the eyelashes across the corneas, causing pain like a thorn in the eye and then permanent blindness. The disease can be transmitted by contact with an infected person, by hands, a towel, or a garment, or carried by flies that have come in contact with discharge from infected eyes. Transmission is enhanced by an intimate relationship between mother and child or within a family or close-knit community.</p><p>Rosalynn and I had noticed during our visits to Masai and Dinka villages that, when seen from a distance, children appeared to be wearing eyeglasses, but when we approached them it was clear that rings of flies were sucking moisture from their eyes. The children rarely brushed the flies away and had never been taught to wash their faces.</p><p>In 1997, at the request of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, The Carter Center decided to make a major effort to help control trachoma in Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria, countries where the average annual income ranges from $100 to $370. We knew that trachoma only deepened the despair and poverty in these communities.</p><p>We began learning about the disease and raising funds to support the new program. Having been a district governor of Lions Clubs International during the mid-1960s, I knew that protecting eyesight was the organization's major benevolent project. I went to their Chicago headquarters to relay our plans, and they pledged a total of $16 million for five years, permitting an expansion of our program to Ethiopia and Sudan. The Hilton Foundation promised $13.6 million for a total of ten years.</p><p>The first cases of trachoma that we saw were in Mali, where Rosalynn, our Carter Center team, and I were joined by Jim Ervin, president of Lions Clubs International, and leaders of Lions Clubs in the country. Through an interpreter, we talked to a blind grandmother who said she was thirty years old. She was holding in her arms a little boy, about the same age as Amy's son, our youngest grandchild. Someone said, "The fl ies cluster shoulder to shoulder around an infected eye." With proper treatment, the grandson would never be blind.</p><p>Along with other organizations involved in the International Trachoma Initiative, we use the acronym SAFE as a guide to treatment: S = surgery, A = antibiotic, F = face cleaning, and E = environment.</p><p>Before surgery, victims carry crude tweezers, with which they pluck out all their eyelashes, but the hairs grow back even sharper. We are able to train nurses or physician's assistants to perform the simple surgery, a fi fteen- minute procedure, to restore the eyelids to their normal position. On surgery day, hundreds of people desperate for relief stream into eyelid surgery camps run by the government and paid for by The Carter Center. We prefer a month of training, which costs six hundred dollars per worker, plus eight hundred dollars for two surgical instrument kits each. The materials for each operation cost about ten dollars.</p><p>In September 2000, Jim Ervin went with me to the headquarters of Pfizer Inc, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, where we met with corporate leaders and I spoke to several hundred of their assembled employees about trachoma. I described the SAFE program and emphasized that their antibiotic Zithromax� had proven to be most effective against the infection. I described how Merck had been contributing free Mectizan� for the treatment of onchocerciasis, and their CEO, William Steere, offered to provide Zithromax� whenever we could set up an effective system in a country for its use. Subsequently, Pfizer has expanded this commitment so that it now includes more than 135 million treatments. This is an invaluable contribution in fifteen of the fifty-five countries where trachoma is endemic.</p><p>Children can be taught by parents, teachers, or health workers to keep their faces clean, and the plethora of flies can be reduced by maintaining a sanitary environment using methods that are taken for granted in the developed world.</p><p>We combat trachoma in six countries, but our most intense effort is in the Amhara region of central Ethiopia, the most severely affected place in the nation. Our survey revealed that up to 80 percent of children there had early stages of the disease. Approximately 1.25 percent of all Ethiopians are blind, the highest incidence in the world, and more than 80 percent have some form of trachoma. Because mothers look after the children and children are the most heavily infected, women are three times more likely to develop the late stage of the disease. Usually the main workers in the house, women incapacitated with trachoma become a special burden. While their children may care for older blind women, younger women are frequently divorced by their husbands and sent back to their parents. In some communities in Ethiopia and Sudan, as many as 20 percent of women over fifteen years old are going blind and risk these social and economic punishments for their illness.</p><p>Dr. Paul Emerson joined The Carter Center as director for the Trachoma Control Program in November 2004. He had devoted nearly a decade to operational research and program evaluation in support of the global effort to control the disease, and under his leadership we quickly extended programs begun by Dr. Jim Zingeser to encourage face washing. Our latest reports from teachers and others show that more than 60 percent of the children are proudly demonstrating clean faces each morning.</p><p>The next stage of our program proved the most interesting and earned me a new reputation in Ethiopia. We learned that it was taboo for women to relieve themselves where they could be seen. They had to either defecate and urinate within their living compounds or restrain themselves until dark. One woman told Dr. Emerson, "I am a prisoner of daylight!" We decided to distribute simple plans for the construction of latrines: just dig a hole in the ground; fix the top with boards, stones, or concrete so it wouldn't cave in; and enclose it for privacy with brush, clay, or cloth. A latrine could be constructed for a cost of less than a dollar.</p><p>As latrines were being built and cleanliness became more important, many communities did not have access to enough soap, and they revived the lost craft of soap making. This provided not only an affordable method of sanitation but also a new product that women could sell to generate income.</p><p>We set an ambitious goal in Amhara district of ten thousand latrines during the first year, but we underestimated the power of women who saw them as a form of liberation. Family by family and village by village, latrine building was adopted as a major project, and 306,000 latrines were built within three years! We encouraged families to hang a gourd filled with water at each entrance, with a tiny hole at the bottom plugged with a stick. When we visited the area in 2005, people were especially proud to show us how they could now wash their faces and hands after using the privy. I became known as the Father of Latrines.</p><p><b>Malaria</b></p><p>There is an apparent anomaly in the current statistics from the World Health Organization on annual deaths from diseases in the developing world, which seem to underestimate the ravages of malaria. In order of deadliness, (1) respiratory diseases come fi rst at 4 million deaths per year, followed by (2) HIV/AIDS, 3 million, (3) malaria, 1 to 5 million, (4) diarrhea, 2.2 million, and (5) tuberculosis, 2 million. But the organization also states, "Malaria kills more than three thousand children each day in sub- Saharan Africa," which amounts to 1.1 million annually just for this age group and geographic area. In Ethiopia, we know that annual deaths from HIV/AIDS are 130,000, while 270,000 die from malaria. This devastating disease causes a lifetime of suffering from chills, diarrhea, pain, and high fevers, with its fatalities concentrated among pregnant women and children in their first five years of life.</p><p>Malaria was prevalent in southwestern Georgia when I was growing up during the Great Depression, and it was not until 1946 that the Communicable Disease Center (CDC) was established, primarily to eliminate this disease. A year later, a vast effort was begun to screen houses and to spray outdoor wet places with DDT, and by 1950 only two thousand cases were reported. Malaria was considered eradicated from the United States by 1951. (The CDC subsequently became known as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Meanwhile, the insecticide DDT has been banned from outdoor use in most nations since its devastating effect on wildlife became known.</p><p>Along with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, malaria qualifies as one of the "big three" diseases for whi...</p></p><h2>A RETURN TO MODESTY: Discovering the Lost Virtue</h2><p>Lamenting the enormous, stress-inducing pressure that today&#39;s society places on young women to be sexually active, a recent college graduate calls for a renewed respect for women&#39;s privacy and their desire to take intimacy seriously. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>The 23-year-old author first heard of "modestyniks"--Orthodox Jewish women who withhold physical contact from men until marriage--while a freshman at Williams College. She was initially fascinated by the way in which they cleave to old ideals, especially amid a sexually saturated contemporary world. But more so, Wendy Shalit was aghast at how modestyniks are dismissed as sick, delusional, or repressed by the secular community. "Why," asks the author, "is sexual modesty so threatening to some that they can only respond to it with charges of abuse or delusion?" <p> In her thoughtful three-part essay, the author reveals an impressive reading list as she probes the cultural history of sexual modesty for women and considers whether this virtue may be beneficial in today's world--if not an antidote to misogyny. In an age when women are embarrassed by sexual inexperience, when sex education is introduced as early as primary school, and when women suffer more than ever from eating disorders, stalking, sexual harassment, and date rape, Shalit believes a return to modesty may place women on equal footing with men. She yearns for a time when conservatives can believe the claims of feminists and feminists can differentiate between patriarchy and misogyny and share in the dialectic of female sexuality. </p><p> While the young author's argument is often limited by naivet� and her own lack of experience, her profound intelligence and daring are undeniable. <i>A Return to Modesty</i> is a thought-provoking debut that introduces an original and exciting new feminist thinker. <i>--Kera Bolonik</i></p>Wendy Shalit received her B.A. in philosophy from Williams College in 1997.

Sharing soul-awakening prayers and affirmations born directly of his high personal state of God-communion, the celebrated author of <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i> shows readers how to achieve their own ecstatic perception of the Divine. <p>Yogananda said, "Let every beat of my heart be a new word in my endless love lyric to Thee. May every sound from my lips carry secret vibrations of Thy voice. Let my every thought be bliss-saturated with Thy presence."</p><p> This edition of <i>Whispers from Eternity</i> has been beautifully re-typset and includes all of Yogananda's later additions. A photographic reproduction of the well-loved first version of Paramahansa Yogananda's inspirational poems and prayers, before he revised the book later in life, is also available from <b>Self-Realization Fellowship - ISBN:9780876121023</b> </p><p></p></p><p>Hailed as "the father of Yoga in the West", Paramahansa Yogananda - author of the spiritual classic <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i> - is regarded as one of the great spiritual figures of our time. Born in India on January 5, 1893, he devoted his life to helping people of all races and creeds to realize and express more fully in their lives the true beauty, nobility, and divinity of the human spirit. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Daya Mata, one of his earliest and closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 1955. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.This is one of my all-time favorite books. Paramhansa Yogananda, who wrote the classic Autobiography of a Yogi, shares his inspiring poem-prayers as well as giving us advice about how to pray. Instead of begging, he says, we need to demand and explains why this is so. By following his advice, we can reach new heights in our understanding of God-Spirit as well as in our relationship to divinity.<br>There are prayers for everything from greeting the dawn and starting our day to prayers for wisdom, prosperity, balance, health, and relationships. This edition has been edited by one of Yogananda's disciples, Nayaswami Kriyananda, so that the words flow a bit better while still remaining true to the content of the original 1949 edition.<br>If you've been looking for a prayer book or one that might inspire you to higher thoughts, feelings, and actions, this is the one for you. It was written for people of all religions and beliefs and is dedicated to the "soul-temples of Christians, Moslems, Buddhists, Hebrews, Hindus, and others...."

The Viennese artist Lisbeth Zwerger, however, goes a long way toward providing a new and refreshed set of images for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the humbug wizard. These illustrations are often cockeyed, with occasional realistic details thrown in, like a crow with a corncob in its beak in the first portrait of the Scarecrow.

The necklace aroused desire first, then a provocative question: Why are personal luxuries so plentiful yet accessible to so few? What if we shared what we desired?

She wondered why she could never clear her desk, never cross off the forty-five tasks on her to-do list. Were there always forty-five things on that list? It sure seemed so. She felt like Sisyphus, the king in the Greek legend who was condemned to push the same rock up a mountain, over and over. Some days she felt like all she accomplished was moving piles. Some papers she could swear she moved a hundred times. Part of the problem was that she was full of ideas, so she was continually adding projects to the list. Executing them, well, that was a skill she hadn&#x2019;t yet mastered.<br><br>Today, the list didn&#x2019;t make her queasy as it often did. She&#x2019;d just finished a deal on a house and so was feeling the high that real estate agents feel when they finally receive their big commission checks. This one represented three months of work and emotional exhaustion. People bought homes when they were undergoing major life transitions, so naturally they were on edge. The shock of prices on the West Coast made those buyers moving to California especially anxious. Because the work was so stressful, Jonell always rewarded herself after each closing.<br><br>She hadn&#x2019;t decided what to buy herself this time, so she headed to the mall just to buy her clients a box of See&#x2019;s candy, part of the gift basket she&#x2019;d have welcoming them to their new home.<br><br>The Pacific View Mall was the only mall in Ventura, a California beach town sixty miles north of Los Angeles. Jonell moved her wiry frame quickly through the dusty-pink shopping enclave, stopping only to glance in the window of Van Gundy &amp; Sons, a decades-old, family- owned jewelry store, the Tiffany&#x2019;s of Ventura. Usually Jonell&#x2019;s glances were as quick as her strides, but this time she stopped. She stared.<br><br>In the center display case a diamond necklace glittered against black velvet. A few years earlier she&#x2019;d searched unsuccessfully for a simple rhinestone necklace to wear to a formal event. Now here it was, the exact one she&#x2019;d had in mind. She recognized the style as the necklace version of the tennis bracelet, so dubbed after tennis champion Chris Evert lost her diamond bracelet during the 1987 U.S. Open and stopped the match to search for it. The diamonds were strung in a single strand all the way to the clasp, the center diamond the largest, the two closest to the clasp the smallest. The gradations were minuscule, the effect breathtaking.<br><br>But this was Van Gundy&#x2019;s. There was no way this necklace was made of rhinestones.<br><br>Jonell rarely wore good jewelry, though she owned her share of it&#x2014; diamond wedding rings from two husbands, 14-karat-gold earrings, pricey watches. Luxury jewelry was something else. Hmm, she thought, wonder what a really expensive piece of jewelry looks like up close? What it would feel like to wear something so lovely and extravagant?<br><br>On a whim she entered the store. &#x201c;Could I see the necklace in the window?&#x201d; she asked nonchalantly, as if she did this every day.<br><br>She reached up to touch the delicate gold chain she wore. Back in 1972 a boyfriend had given her this necklace with the peace symbol pendant, and in 2003, at the start of the war in Iraq, she&#x2019;d put it on again. She placed the diamond stunner over her old gold charm. It was, she thought, simply exquisite&#x2014;and exquisitely simple.<br><br>She took a breath, and as she breathed out, she asked the price.<br><br>&#x201c;Thirty-seven thousand dollars.&#x201d;<br><br>Jonell couldn&#x2019;t stop the gasp. All she could think was Who buys a thirty-seven-thousand-dollar necklace?<br><br>She looked in the mirror again. She couldn&#x2019;t help but think about the choices she&#x2019;d made in her life, the ones that guaranteed she could never afford a necklace like this. She thought about how different her life might have been if she&#x2019;d married a wealthy man or invested herself more in a career. If she&#x2019;d worked harder, maybe she could have generated the kind of money that would enable her to indulge in this kind of luxury. In the end, none of this mattered, not really. In a world overflowing with need, the idea of owning a thirty-seven- thousand-dollar necklace was morally indefensible to Jonell, who&#x2019;d mentored disadvantaged kids for six years. Lost in these thoughts, she heard only snippets of the saleswoman&#x2019;s description: 118 diamonds . . . brilliant-cut . . . mined from nonconflict areas . . . 15.24 carats.<br><br>Fifteen carats sounded ostentatious and Jonell didn&#x2019;t like ostentation. She appraised it again. There was nothing ostentatious about this necklace. The diamonds were so small, just right for her five-foot-two-inch frame, yet circling clear around her neck they felt substantial. What was magnetic was their radiance. She&#x2019;d never seen diamonds shimmer like these.<br><br>Jonell hesitated to take off the necklace. After admiring it another minute, she laid it back on the counter and thanked the saleswoman for her time.<br><br>Over the next three weeks Jonell was surprised how often she thought about the diamond necklace. When she was back at the mall with her eighty-six-year-old mother, Jonell noticed the necklace still in the window. &#x201c;Mom, I want to show you something,&#x201d; she said, excitedly leading her mother into the store as if she were seven and heading for her first Barbie. &#x201c;Mom, try it on.&#x201d; Her mother&#x2019;s eyes widened as she clicked the clasp. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful,&#x201d; she whispered. Jonell&#x2019;s mother knew quality, so her admiration told Jonell that the design was classic, timeless.<br><br>When Jonell peeled her eyes away from the diamonds brightening her mother&#x2019;s neck, she glanced at the tag: twenty-two thousand dollars. On the counter, an ad announced a sale in which the store would take bids on any item of jewelry on display.<br><br>Jonell remembered being thirty and in need of a respite. Burned out from her job as a speech therapist in Santa Cruz and weary of her long-term boyfriend, she&#x2019;d gone to New York City to live with her best friend from senior year at the University of Southern California. Jonell witnessed her roommate washing her face with Perrier. She saw her wrap herself in a full-length lynx coat. That&#x2019;s when Jonell took stock of her own chances for such luxuries. They were slim to nil. That reality aroused not envy but curiosity: Why was personal luxury accessible to so few? After six months, Jonell left New York to return to her native California, but the question had never left her. Now it loomed large again.<br><br>Why is it, she wondered, that we can stand shoulder to shoulder to enjoy sumptuous masterpieces in art museums? That whole crowds can admire magnificent landscapes together in national parks? Why can&#x2019;t we share personal luxuries the same way?<br><br>And an idea was born: &#x201c;I could wear a luxury item if I bought it with other women,&#x201d; she thought. &#x201c;No one woman needs to have a fifteen- carat diamond necklace all the time.

A thousand dollars would not be out of line for most of my friends. . . . If I could convince only eleven women to go in with me, I could bid twelve thousand. . . . It&#x2019;s already come down fifteen thousand. Why not another ten?&#x201d;<br><br>Jonell started making calls to friends and colleagues. She talked to women in her walking group and investment club. Women she&#x2019;d met at seminars, parties, charity events. Most of the women she approached said no. No money. No time. No interest in diamonds. The responses fired off rapidly: &#x201c;A formula for disaster. Everyone will fight over it.&#x201d; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the point of buying diamonds?&#x201d; &#x201c;I can get a better deal at the jewelry mart.&#x201d; &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never get twelve women to get along.&#x201d; &#x201c;If I&#x2019;m going to spend a thousand dollars, I want something just for myself.&#x201d;<br><br>Even her mother fired off a round: &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll lose friends over this.&#x201d;<br><br>Some comments unsettled Jonell, filling her with self-doubt. Some spurred her to argue. Some she ignored. But she stayed fixed on her goal. She went back to women who&#x2019;d said no. She asked new women. In two months she had a group of seven. Close enough, she decided. By the time her Visa bill would arrive, she&#x2019;d have found the rest.<br><br>three generations of Van Gundy men were in the store the Saturday of the sale: Kent Van Gundy, age eighty, who&#x2019;d started the business in 1957 and was now retired; Tom Van Gundy, fifty-four, his son, who&#x2019;d taken over the business; and Sean, twenty-nine, his grandson, who now managed the store.<br><br>Tom says he&#x2019;ll never forget that day. Sean won&#x2019;t forget it either. These women were different from the ones the Van Gundys usually encounter. So many women who come into jewelry stores aren&#x2019;t happy, says Sean. Their eyes are anxious, their faces tense. Some are in tears. They&#x2019;re lonely and looking for someone to talk to. Something&#x2019;s missing in their lives, and they&#x2019;re looking to fill the empty spaces. These women rushed into the store smiling, eager to be there shortly after the doors opened to beat any competing bidders. Jonell showed the necklace to the four who came with her, two who&#x2019;d said yes to her proposition, two who&#x2019;d said no but didn&#x2019;t want to miss the fun. Mary Karrh, a head taller than Jonell, found herself so far removed from her daily life as an accountant that her expression was one of wonder.

His latest collection of novellas, The River Swimmer, is Harrison at his most memorable: a brilliant rendering of two men striving to find their way in the world, written with freshness, abundant wit, and profound humanity.</p><p>Jim Harrison is the author of over thirty books of poetry, nonfiction, and fiction, including <i>Legends of the Fall</i>, <i>The Road Home</i>, <i>Returning to Earth</i>, and <i>The Summer He Didn&#x2019;t Die</i>. A member of American Academy of Arts and Letters and winner of a Guggenheim Fellowship, he has had work published in twenty-seven languages. Harrison lives in Montana and Arizona.<b>Praise for <i>The River Swimmer</i></b><br><br> In his fiction, especially, [Harrison has] hit a deep groove. His meditations on mortality are blended with an antic wit. . . . Mr. Harrison&#x2019;s new book, <i>The River Swimmer</i> . . . contains some of the best writing of his career. Both novellas burn brightly with what he calls, at one point, unmitigated cupidity,&#x2019; not for money or possessions but for life and experience. . . . He is among the most indelible American novelists of the last hundred years . . . Mr. Harrison contains multitudes; like a good rabbit liver p�t�, there is a lot of him to spread around. . . . If <i>The River Swimmer</i> is any indication, he remains at the height of his powers.&#x201d; Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br> Trenchant and visionary . . . Harrison is a writer of the body, which he celebrates as the ordinary, essential and wondrous instrument by which we measure the world. Without it, there is no philosophy. And with it, of course, philosophy can be a rocky test. . . . I could feel Jim Harrison grinning . . . in his glorious novella <i>The River Swimmer</i>.&#x201d; Ron Carlson, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> [Harrison] has crafted gorgeous and wry sentences out of the quiet raging against the indignities and infirmities of age. And, in Clive, he has created another indelible and soulful rascal. . . . Harrison is one of our greatest voices of aging both clumsily and well and of teasing out hope amid sentimentality and dread.&#x201d; Ian Crouch, <i>The Boston Globe </i><br><br> You can&#x2019;t escape your true nature, Jim Harrison&#x2019;s two new novellas assert. . . . Here, he&#x2019;s achieved a mood that approximates in modern terms the tranquility of Shakespeare&#x2019;s late romances. The existential uncertainties that always animate Harrison&#x2019;s fiction are not so much resolved as accepted for what they are: the basic fabric of existence, from which we pluck as much happiness as we can.&#x201d; Wendy Smith, <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br> [Harrison&#x2019;s] latest book of novellas . . .deepens and broadens his already openhearted and smart-minded sense of the way we live now, and what we might do to improve it. . . . Harrison [is] the reigning master of the [novella] form. . . . I have to say that Harrison has been hard put to better his personal best, <i>Legends of the Fall</i>. . . . But with the lead piece in this new book, the autumnal novella he calls <i>The Land of Unlikeness</i>,&#x2019; he comes quite close. . . . The new novella is . . . no less intense, as it enriches and enlarges an emotion-charged period in the life of Clive, a divorced Midwestern painter-turned-critic. . . . What does the male version of quality of life really mean? Something like this, something like this. And female readers who don&#x2019;t give over some time to studying Harrison&#x2019;s version of it will be as foolish as the men.&#x201d; Alan Cheuse, NPR<br><br> Ever since writing <i>Legends of the Fall</i> 30 years ago, Jim Harrison has produced a steady stream of novellas demonstrating what a writer can do in approximately 100 pages. The trick to a good novella is to give the same richness of story, action and characters as one finds in a full-length novel. At its best, it is a novel shorn of fat, full of story.&#x201d; Steve Novak, <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i><br><br> Tales of manhood and magic . . . Harrison addresses with insight and humor such themes as the human relationship to the natural world, the powers of sexuality and violence, the uses of art, the line between sanity and madness, and the shadow of mortality.&#x201d; Colette Bancroft, <i>Tampa Bay Times</i><br><br> Exquisite . . . While the first novella is about the constancy of the past to reassert itself in our lives, the second focuses on the inescapable currents that bear us into the future. . . . The two novellas masterfully treat themes that will be familiar to Harrison&#x2019;s readers the disjunction between contemporary life and rural terrain, our inability to escape the past, the vapidity of urbanity. The writing is sparse but powerful. . . . this diptych of a collection is a joy.&#x201d; Ted Hart, <i>Kansas City Star</i><br><br> Refreshing . . . <i>The River Swimmer</i> is Harrison at his crusty best.&#x201d; Bruce Jacobs, Shelf Awareness (online)<br><br> Jim Harrison is a master of the novella form.&#x201d; Steve Byrne, <i>Detroit Free Press</i><br><br> The ways in which [the two novellas] complement and contrast with each other attests to [Harrison&#x2019;s] range. . . . Everyday epiphanies from a major author.&#x201d; <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> [A] fine new collection . . .Harrison&#x2019;s novellas are each striking in their own ways, rich and satisfying.&#x201d; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> Harrison is one of America&#x2019;s great literary treasures; his rugged, beautifully tough-minded works help define America and its wide-open spaces, and his readers form almost a cult.

His work has been translated into more than fifty languages, and the most recent of his many honors is the Yomiuri Literary Prize, whose previous recipients include Yukio Mishima, Kenzaburo Oe, and Kobo Abe.</p><b>Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman</b>When I closed my eyes, the scent of the wind wafted up toward me. A May wind, swelling up like a piece of fruit, with a rough outer skin, slimy flesh, dozens of seeds. The flesh split open in midair, spraying seeds like gentle buckshot into the bare skin of my arms, leaving behind a faint trace of pain.&#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d; my cousin asked me. About eight inches shorter than me, he had to look up when he talked.I glanced at my watch. &#x201c;Ten twenty.&#x201d;&#x201c;Does that watch tell good time?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yeah, I think so.&#x201d;My cousin grabbed my wrist to look at the watch. His slim, smooth fingers were surprisingly strong. &#x201c;Did it cost a lot?&#x201d;&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s pretty cheap,&#x201d; I said, glancing again at the timetable.No response.My cousin looked confused. The white teeth between his parted lips looked like bones that had atrophied.<i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty cheap,&#x201d;</i> I said, looking right at him, carefully repeating the words. <i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty cheap, but it keeps good time.&#x201d;</i>My cousin nodded silently. My cousin can&#x2019;t hear well out of his right ear. Soon after he went into elementary school he was hit by a baseball and it screwed up his hearing. That doesn&#x2019;t keep him from functioning normally most of the time. He attends a regular school, leads an entirely normal life. In his classroom, he always sits in the front row, on the right, so he can keep his left ear toward the teacher. And his grades aren&#x2019;t so bad. The thing is, though, he goes through periods when he can hear sounds pretty well, and periods when he can&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s cyclical, like the tides. And sometimes, maybe twice a year, he can barely hear anything out of either ear. It&#x2019;s like the silence in his right ear deepens to the point where it crushes out any sound on the left side. When that happens, ordinary life goes out the window and he has to take some time off from school. The doctors are basi- cally stumped. They&#x2019;ve never seen a case like it, so there&#x2019;s nothing they can do.&#x201c;Just because a watch is expensive doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s accurate,&#x201d; my cousin said, as if trying to convince himself. &#x201c;I used to have a pretty expensive watch, but it was always off. I got it when I started junior high, but I lost it a year later. Since then I&#x2019;ve gone without a watch. They won&#x2019;t buy me a new one.&#x201d;&#x201c;Must be tough to get along without one,&#x201d; I said.&#x201c;What?&#x201d; he asked.<i>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it hard to get along without a watch?&#x201d;</i> I repeated, looking right at him.&#x201c;No, it isn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he replied, shaking his head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m living off in the mountains or something. If I want to know the time I just ask somebody.&#x201d;&#x201c;True enough,&#x201d; I said.We were silent again for a while.I knew I should say something more, try to be kind to him, try to make him relax a little until we arrived at the hospital. But it had been five years since I saw him last. In the meanwhile he&#x2019;d grown from nine to fourteen, and I&#x2019;d gone from twenty to twenty-five. And that span of time had created a translucent barrier between us that was hard to traverse. Even when I had to say something, the right words just wouldn&#x2019;t come out. And every time I hesitated, every time I swallowed back something I was about to say, my cousin looked at me with a slightly confused look on his face. His left ear tilted ever so slightly toward me.&#x201c;What time is it now?&#x201d; he asked me.&#x201c;Ten twenty-nine,&#x201d; I replied.It was ten thirty-two when the bus finally rolled into view.

Disney and the Creation of an Entertainment Empires</h2><p>A look at the life of the brother of Walt Disney reveals the stormy relationship between the two siblings, Roy&#39;s ingenious business savvy, and his dedication to making his brother&#39;s dream of creating a theme park come true.</p><p>One night, at a Los Angeles dinner gala, Walt Disney gave a rare public statement about his older brother, Roy: "We started the business here in 1923, and if it hadn't been for my big brother, I swear I'd've been in jail several times for checks bouncing. I never knew what was in the bank. He kept me on the straight and narrow."<p> Although Walt wasn't quite that ignorant of the numbers, it's true that Roy handled most of the finances for the Disney empire. It was Roy who kept the studio running in the early years, Roy who put together the financing deals for Disneyland, Roy who oversaw the completion of Walt Disney World in Florida after his brother's death in 1966.</p><p> <i>Building a Company</i> provides plenty of anecdotal details about the Disney entertainment empire's rise to power. Don't look for juicy scandal, though: Bob Thomas's fully authorized (and, ultimately, Disney-financed) biography steers clear of any controversies, such as Disney's attempts to get out of a contract with ABC in the late '50s, before they can cause a blight on the success story.

In this eccentric and unpredictable memoir, one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most intellectually nimble artists shares his view of the world, of America and his place in it.<br><br>A Romanian by birth, restless by inclination, Steinberg lived a peripatetic existence. In Reflections and Shadows, he introduces us to his family&#x2014;his uncle Moritz, a sign painter, and his father (also Moritz), a bookbinder whose small factory produced cardboard boxes and ribbons for funeral wreaths. He tells us how he dodged the police in fascist Italy in 1940 and how he came to America, where he became a citizen, an officer in the U.S. Navy, and the foremost visionary satirist of his time.<br><br>No one has depicted America with all its strengths and foibles more enduringly than Saul Steinberg. In this playful meditation, based on a series of interviews with Aldo Buzzi that has never before been published in English, and interwoven with more than a dozen drawings, Steinberg delivers a laconic hymn to America: its baseball, its diners, and its exhibitionism. &#x201c;It is stinginess,&#x201d; Steinberg writes, speaking of his art and method, &#x201c;that holds us back.&#x201d; But he had none of that: the personality that emerges from these pages is capacious, acutely discriminating, full of serendipitous curiosities, and consistently engaging.</p><p>&#x201c;America was made to order for Steinberg. In linking art to the modern consciousness, no artist is more relevant.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Harold Rosenberg<br><br>&#x201c;Steinberg is our national treasure, his hand the hand through which the nation inscribes itself in order to discover its true soul.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Arthur Danto<br><br>&#x201c;For decades he has been regarded as the best cartoonist in America....[His oeuvre is] the product of an intelligence so finely drawn, restless, ironic, insinuating and (at times) sadistic, so refracted in its own seemingly innocent maze of linguistic mirrors, as to suggest no ready parallels. The best of Steinberg presents you with a master. But a master of what? The short answer is: of writing.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Robert HughesBorn on June 15, 1914, in Romania, Saul Steinberg studied philosophy and literature at the University of Bucharest and architecture in Milan, where he published cartoons from 1936 to 1939. He fled to America in 1940 and joined the navy. After the war he settled down in New York and became an internationally celebrated artist, contributing some of his best work for more than fifty years to The New Yorker. His previous books include All in Line, The Passport, The Labyrinth, The Inspector, and The Discovery of America. Steinberg elevated the graphic language of the cartoon to the realm of fine art and came to be recognized as one of the most original artists of his time. He died in 1999.<br><br>Aldo Buzzi was trained as an architect in Milan. He worked in the Italian cinema for many years and then as a publisher.

Were the privateers out in full force again? Had Napoleon's navy a secret new weapon? Lieutenant Lord Nicholas Ramage sets out from Jamaica to discover what treachery is threatening to throw the British navy into chaos.</p><p>Dudley Bernard Egerton Pope was born in 1925 into an ancient Cornish seafaring family. He joined the Merchant Navy at the age of sixteen and spent much of his early life at sea. He was torpedoed during the Second World War and resulting spinal injuries plagued him for the rest of his life. Towards the end of the war Pope turned to journalism, becoming the Naval and Defence Correspondent for the &#39;London Evening News&#39;. At this time he also researched naval history and in time became an authority on the Napoleonic era and Nelson&#39;s exploits, resulting in several well received volumes, especially on the Battles of Copenhagen and Trafalgar. Encouraged by Hornblower creator CS Forester, he also began writing fiction using his own experiences in the Navy and his extensive historical research as a basis. In 1965, he wrote &#39;Ramage&#39;, the first of his highly successful series of novels following the exploits of the heroic &#39;Lord Nicholas Ramage&#39; during the Napoleonic Wars. Another renowned series is centred on &#39;Ned Yorke&#39;, a buccaneer in the seventeenth century Caribbean and then with a descendant following the &#39;Yorke&#39; family naval tradition when involved in realistic secret operations during the Second World War. Dudley Pope lived aboard boats whenever possible, along with his wife and daughter, and this was where he wrote the majority of his novels. Most of his adult life was spent in the Caribbean and in addition to using the locale for fictional settings he also wrote authoritatively on naval history of the region, including a biography of the buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan. He died in 1997 aged seventy one. &#39;The first and still favourite rival to Hornblower&#39; - Daily Mirror"The first and still favourite rival to Hornblower."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Daily Mirror </i><br><br>"An author who really knows Nelson's navy."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Observer</i></p><h2>The State of the Art</h2><p>The first ever collection of Iain Banks' short fiction, this volume includes the acclaimed novella, The State of the Art. This is a striking addition to the growing body of Culture lore, and adds definition and scale to the previous works by using the Earth of 1977 as contrast. The other stories in the collection range from science fiction to horror, dark-coated fantasy to morality tale. All bear the indefinable stamp of Iain Banks' staggering talent.<br></p><p>Iain Banks came to widespread and controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, THE WASP FACTORY, in 1984. He has since gained enormous popular and critical acclaim for both his mainstream and his science fiction novels.Accompanied by a lengthy essay, "A Few Notes on the Culture" (1997), these seven arresting short stories and the disturbing novella that provides the title for Banks's latest SF collection all date from 1984&#x2013;1987, the period of his bizarre mainstream novel <i>The Wasp Factory </i>and the extravagant genre novel <i>Consider Phlebas, </i>both cult-inspiring works. In short pieces like "Road of Skulls" and "Piece," Banks turns convention upside down and inside out, with shocker-endings that linger like smoke rising from a crematorium. "Odd Attachment" traces a marooned spaceman and his AI suit on a tortuous survival trek across an uninhabited planet, illustrating Banks's preoccupation with the "self-generative belief system" that applies to both humans and AIs in the Culture, the setting for the title story and some of his SF novels. Viewing Earth and <i>Homo sapiens</i> through the eyes of the Culture, a galactic group-civilization spawned by a handful of humanoid species several thousand years in the past, allows Banks to speculate on his dearest philosophical topics: the preferability of anarchy in space, denunciation of market economies as "synthetic evil," never-ending education for both humans and machines, and genetic manipulation. For all their wrenching images and sadistic twists, Banks's unsettling tales bestow a grim gift, the ability to see ourselves as others might see us. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For Wiseman, a 100-year-old leather notebook, filled with lace patterns and samples and belonging to a Miss Blanche Beau of Sacramento, CA, was the jumping-off place for adventures in deciphering, rewriting, and charting a marvelous collection of old lace edgings. Comprehensive information on the tools and techniques of lace knitting makes this book a good choice for beginners, while the more than 58 lace patterns included will appeal to the more experienced. Rounding out the book are 15 projects designed to use the edgings.

Among the themes Mayes explores are how her experience of Tuscany dramatically expanded when she renovated and became a part-time resident of a 13th century house with a stone roof&nbsp;in the mountains above Cortona, how life in the mountains introduced her to a "wilder" side of Tuscany--and with it a lively &nbsp;engagement with Tuscany's mountain people. Throughout, she reveals the concrete joys of life in her adopted hill town, with particular attention to&nbsp;life in the piazza, the art of Luca Signorelli (Renaissance painter from Cortona), and the pastoral pleasures of feasting from her garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving always toward a deeper engagement, Mayes writes of Tuscan icons that&nbsp;have become for her storehouses of memory, of crucible moments from which bigger ideas emerged,&nbsp;and&nbsp;of the writing life she has enjoyed in the room where<i> Under the Tuscan Sun</i> began.<br>&nbsp;<br>With more on the pleasures of life at<i> Bramasole</i>, the delights and challenges of living in Italy day-to-day and favorite recipes,<i> Every Day in Tuscany</i> is a passionate and inviting account of the richness and complexity of Italian life.</p><p><strong>Kim Sun�e Reviews <em>Every Day in Tuscany</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong>Kim Sun�e is the author of <em>Trail of Crumbs: Hunger, Love, and the Search for Home</em>.</strong> <p></p> <p>"The Bard of Tuscany" (<em>New York Times</em>) is back and better than ever. Two decades have passed since the purchase of Bramasole, Frances Mayes&#x2019;s first Italian adventure into the meaning of home, made famous in <em>Under the Tuscan Sun</em> and <em>Bella Tuscany</em>. In <em>Every Day in Tuscany</em>, her third beautifully rendered memoir, Mayes generously serves up another delicious helping. She continues to contemplate the satisfaction of a life created by one&#x2019;s own hard work, but also celebrates the joys of the piazza, reminisces on her South Georgia roots, reveals her love of architecture and painting, and is especially hungry to follow the trail (which she has generously mapped out for us) of Renaissance painter Luca Signorelli.</p> <p>After transforming Bramasole, you&#x2019;d think that Mayes would have had enough of repairs and renovations, but she expands the idea of belonging with the purchase of a mountainside cottage. One day, as she and husband, Ed, are picking blackberries on a rugged slope above Cortona, Mayes writes of being "fatally attracted" to a "lonesome beauty," a partially collapsed stone-roof cottage. This new home becomes a place of comfort, especially when something shifts, when "one glorious summer evening at Bramasole," Mayes writes, "something unexpected intruded on this paradise."</p> <p>Enchanted by the simple life, a life lived in accordance with the cycles of the sun and moon, Mayes tells her story through the seasons of a country and those of the heart. Winter is about restoring privacy, summer for reading, moonlight swims, watermelon and plum crostata. Mostly, though, the seasons are made up of days meant for being. She admires the Italians for their ease and grace of pure existence. "How do Italian friends naturally keep the jouissance they were born with?" she wonders.</p> <p>Since Mayes is a poet first, her prose is infused with startling and indelible moments, and she will always inspire you to cook something. Luckily, there are recipes for everything from Melva&#x2019;s Peach Pie to Risotto with White Truffles, as well as mouthwatering menus, including Roasted Garlic with Walnuts and Guinea Hen with Pancetta. Of the choreography of the kitchen, she writes, "meat glistens, lettuces float, you sneeze, I sing oh, my love, my darling, and dough rises in soft moons the size of my cupped hand as planet earth tilts us toward dinner."</p> <p>People are always eating in Mayes&#x2019;s world, and eating well. But good food is essential for a good life, which includes travel and the private discovery of something no less significant than a new star. On watching a couple from Milan eat a midday meal consisting of a full antipasto platter, risotto, then steaks, she writes, "Those are delicious moments for the traveler--a fine lunch with someone you love, poring over the <em>The Blue Guide</em> and <em>Gambero Rosso</em>, a weekend to explore a new place and each other."</p> <p>More than anything, <em>Every Day in Tuscany</em> is a book for all travelers, those hungry hearts craving a lesson in living life to the fullest, whether at home or on the road. "It is paradoxical but true," she tells us, "that something that takes you out of yourself also restores you to yourself with a greater freedom.... The excitement of exploration sprang me from a life I knew how to live into a challenging space where I was forced--and overjoyed--to invent each new day."</p> <p>With Mayes as our luminous North Star, we can navigate our way to a place where--if we are lucky--we will choose the road less-traveled, find our own rugged mountainside, and become part of the landscape, perhaps even find a sense of self, if not a place to call home.</p>In addition to her Tuscany memoirs,&nbsp;<i>Under the Tuscan Sun</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Bella Tuscany</i>, Frances Mayes is the author of the travel memoir&nbsp;<i>A Year in the World</i>; the illustrated books&nbsp;<i>In Tuscany</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Bringing Tuscany Home</i>;&nbsp;<i>Swan</i>, a novel;&nbsp;<i>The Discovery of Poetry</i>, a text for readers; and five books of poetry.&nbsp; She divides her time between homes in&nbsp;Italy&nbsp;and&nbsp;North Carolina.&nbsp; Visit France Mayes&#x2019;s blog at www.francesmayesbooks.com.</p><h2>American Aircraft of World War II</h2><p>This book provides a useful guide to some 120 aircraft that served with the US Air Force from 1939-1945.

A quick flip through the pages showed some remarkable reproductions of squadron markings and nose art, perfect for what I had in mind. Once I got it I found out exactly what a treasure it is. In addition to American markings there are some from other countries, mostly allied like China, Honduras, Free French, etc. But there are also some pictures of captured aircraft with Luftwaffe markings, something I have never seen before. In addition to the numerous drawings, including some truly awesome two page all angle views of some of the more famous planes like the P-51, P-47, P-40, and the P-38 (just to name some), the information content for each plane was enormous. Starting with the experimental or test designation, to the first operational version, through the different variants (including the alternate names for export versions) and armament loadouts. Far beyond what I thought I was getting and well worth twice as much as I paid for it. If you want in-depth information on American built aircraft during WWII, this is a must have book.</p><h2>Not Becoming My Mother: and Other Things She Taught Me Along the Way</h2><p>Reflects on the author&#39;s mother, focusing on her early life as a bookstore owner and housewife and the diaries she kept which had been retrieved by her daughter after her death.</p><p><b>Ruth Reichl</b> is the editor in chief of <i>Gourmet</i> and the author of three bestselling memoirs, <i>Comfort Me with Apples, Tender at the Bone,</i> and <i>Garlic &amp; Sapphires</i>, and was the editor for the comprehensive <i>Gourmet Cookbook</i>.

Determined that her daughter Ruth would pursue a career other than simply being someone&#39;s wife, Miriam Brudno was not thrilled with Ruth&#39;s early marriage or culinary writing. (Reichl is now the editor-in-chief of GOURMET magazine.) Reichl&#39;s capable narration of this insightful memoir reveals a gradual blossoming of empathy for her mother as she discovers personal correspondence and odd bits of her diary. Reading at a brisk pace, Reichl punctuates her mother&#39;s sometimes-astonishing pronouncements with wry humor and realizes too late--after her mother&#39;s death--the extent of her wish for Ruth to find the satisfaction she never achieved.

He had been captured by Christian pirates in the Mediterranean and imprisoned by the pope, then released, baptized, and allowed a European life of scholarship as the Christian writer Giovanni Leone. In this fascinating new book, the distinguished historian Natalie Zemon Davis offers a virtuoso study of the fragmentary, partial, and often contradictory traces that al-Hasan al-Wazzan left behind him, and a superb interpretation of his extraordinary life and work. &nbsp;Davis describes all the sectors of her hero's life in rich detail, scrutinizing the evidence of al-Hasan's movement between cultural worlds; the Islamic and Arab traditions, genres, and ideas available to him; and his adventures with Christians and Jews in a European community of learned men and powerful church leaders. In depicting the life of this adventurous border-crosser, Davis suggests the many ways cultural barriers are negotiated and diverging traditions are fused.</p><p><b>Natalie Zemon Davis</b> is Henry Charles Lea Professor of History Emeritus at Princeton University.

Paraded through the streets of Rome in an elaborate ceremony and named &#x201c;Annone,&#x201d; or Hanno, by welcoming Romans, the elephant represented to the pope the king&#x2019;s intention to bring the realms that extended from North Africa to India into the Christian fold. Hanno survived in his pen for three years, a presence at public events and festivities and a favorite of the pope and the Roman populace. He was written about by poets, mythographers, and satirists, and imaged in drawings, paintings, and woodcuts; in fountain ornament, bas-relief, and majolica platter. Raphael designed his memorial fresco.1<br><br>In 1518 a Spanish pirate, fresh from successful raids against Muslim ships in the Mediterranean, presented the same pope with a captured North African traveler and diplomat from Fez named al-Hasan al-Wazzan. He would serve as a useful source of information, it was hoped, and as a symbol in the pope&#x2019;s desired crusade against the Ottoman Turks and the religion of Islam. Had not the Turks been an increased threat to Christendom since their conquest of Constantinople in 1453? The diplomat&#x2019;s arrival and imprisonment were noted in diaries and diplomatic correspondence. His baptism at St. Peter&#x2019;s fifteen months later was a grand ceremony. A librarian recorded his book-borrowing. But compared to Hanno, al-Hasan al-Wazzan&#x2019;s nine years in Italy went unrecorded by those who saw him, his presence unmemorialized by those whom he served or knew, his likeness not drawn and redrawn, his return to North Africa referred to only later and obliquely. Only a shred of his life remained in the memory of Europeans interested in Arabic letters and travel literature, to be passed on orally and reported years later.<br><br>In North Africa there are also baffling silences. During the years when al-Hasan al-Wazzan was serving as agent for the sultan of Fez in towns along Morocco&#x2019;s Atlantic coast, no mention of him was made by Portuguese military men and administrators in their chatty letters to King Manuel. During years when he had diplomatic duties in Cairo, no mention of him was made by a sharp-eyed observer who wrote in his journal of visitors to the court of the Mamluk rulers of Egypt and the Levant.<br><br>Yet al-Hasan al-Wazzan left behind in Italy several manuscripts, one of which, published in 1550, became a bestseller. Over the centuries his book attracted the curiosity of readers and scholars in many parts of the world. The mysteries about him and even his name began already with the first edition. Giovanni Battista Ramusio, the editor, entitled the book <i>La Descrittione dell&#x2019;Africa</i> (The Description of Africa), called its author by his baptismal name, &#x201c;Giovan Lioni Africano,&#x201d; and included a brief biography of him in his dedication. So he was known in the several subsequent editions of the book that were published in Venice as the first volume in Ramusio&#x2019;s series of <i>Navigations and Voyages</i>. And so he was known in the European translations that soon appeared: &#x201c;Iean Leon, African [<i>sic</i>]&#x201d; in French (1556); &#x201c;Ioannes Leo Africanus&#x201d; in Latin (1556); and &#x201c;Iohn Leo, a More&#x201d; in English (1600). Through the German translation (1805) of &#x201c;Johann Leo der Africaner,&#x201d; his book continued to shape European visions of Africa, all the more strongly because it came from someone who had lived and traveled in those parts.2<br><br>Meanwhile a scholar at the Escorial library in Spain, himself a Maronite Christian from Syria, came upon an Arabic manuscript on another topic by al-Wazzan. It bore both his Muslim and his Christian names, which the librarian included in his published catalogue (1760-70). A century later, when the <i>Description</i> was enshrined in the <i>Recueil de voyages</i> (Collection of Voyages) by the important French Orientalist Charles Schefer, an Arabic name appeared in the introduction; and in the classic Hakluyt Society series of travel literature in England, the title page proclaimed: &#x201c;by Al-Hassan Ibn-Mohammed Al-Wezaz Al-Fasi, a Moor, baptized as Giovanni Leone, but better known as Leo Africanus.&#x201d;3<br><br>Still its author remained a shadowy figure. Then in the early decades of the twentieth century, a few scholars approached the book and the man in new ways. In the context of the new French &#x201c;colonial sciences&#x201d; concerning the geography, history, and ethnography of Africa, the young Louis Massignon did his Sorbonne thesis on Morocco in the early sixteenth century as it had been described by &#x201c;L�on l&#x2019;Africain.&#x201d; From a close reading of the text (a technique that would flower in his later great publications on Sufi mysticism and poetry), Massignon extracted what he could not only about the geography of Morocco but also about al-Wazzan&#x2019;s life and travels, especially about his sources and methods of observing and classifying. The frame of al-Wazzan&#x2019;s book was &#x201c;very Europeanized,&#x201d; Massignon opined, but &#x201c;its core was very Arabic.&#x201d; Massignon&#x2019;s study was published in 1906, an important moment in France&#x2019;s steps toward establishing its protectorate of Morocco.4<br><br>The historical geographer Angela Codazzi knew Massignon&#x2019;s book well and took seriously his hope that an original manuscript of al-Wazzan&#x2019;s book would one day be found. Close to the collections in Italy&#x2019;s libraries, in 1933 she could announce that she had located an Italian manuscript of <i>The Description of Africa</i>, and it did indeed differ from the later printed edition of Ramusio. At the same time, Giorgio Levi della Vida, a remarkable scholar of Semitic languages and literatures, was making discoveries as well. Excluded from university teaching in 1931 as an antifascist, he was invited to catalogue the Arabic manuscripts at the Vatican Library. He left for the United States in 1939&#x2014;an act of safety for a Jew&#x2014;but not before putting the finishing touches on a book about the creation of the Oriental collections at the Vatican. Among its many riches, it had much to say about the reading, writing, and signing practices of al-Hasan al-Wazzan. Back in Italy after the war, Levi della Vida helped Codazzi interpret two manuscripts on other subjects that she had found by &#x201c;Giovanni Leone Africano.&#x201d;5<br><br>The last important colonial presentation of Jean-L�on l&#x2019;Africain was a new French translation and commentary prepared by Alexis �paulard. During years in Morocco as a physician and military officer with the French protectorate, �paulard had become impressed with &#x201c;the exceptional value,&#x201d; both historical and geographical, of <i>The Description of Africa</i>. His book built upon the work of Massignon and Codazzi, without following their spirit. �paulard used the Italian manuscript in Rome in 1939&#x2014;and applauded Codazzi&#x2019;s plan to publish it one day (alas, unfulfilled)&#x2014;but his <i>Description</i> is an amalgam of translations from Ramusio, occasional translations from the manuscript, and a modernized version of the sixteenth-century French translation. He ignored the possibility that the differences between the texts could reveal larger differences in viewpoint and cultural sensibility.<br><br>Like Massignon&#x2019;s book, the �paulard edition confronted assertions made in the <i>Description</i> with evidence from outside its pages&#x2014;from the distance between places to the unrolling of historical events&#x2014;and corrected al-Wazzan when necessary. Geographical names were clarified, and Arab authors he cited were identified. To achieve this, �paulard assembled a team of French scholars in sub-Saharan studies, two of them then based in Dakar at the Institut Fran�ais d&#x2019;Afrique Noire, and consulted specialists in North African folklore and historiography. The notes are useful, but they did not address the question raised by Massignon about where the text or its author was positioned in regard to the world he was writing about and the world he was writing for. Differences were smoothed over again: �paulard liked to think that &#x201c;Jean L�on&#x201d; had never left his Christian life in Italy.<br><br>�paulard did not live to see the fulfillment of his project. The team finished it up, and the <i>Description</i> was published in Paris by the Institut des Hautes �tudes Marocaines in 1956, three years after Morocco became an independent state.6<br><br>The �paulard team had particularly envisaged their readers as historians of Africa, and soon scholars of sub-Saharan Africa began to have their say about al-Wazzan&#x2019;s reliability as a witness. In the late decades of the century, specialists from Europe, Africa, and America compared his pages on Black Africa with other evidence and later accounts: some claimed he gave convincing, precious detail on little-known societies and kingdoms, others that he was reporting tall stories picked up in Timbuktu and had never traveled beyond its borders. Here a ruler verified, there a conquest found false, here a trading practice confirmed, there a fire mentioned by no one else but al-Wazzan. All these approaches&#x2014;in worthy pursuit of &#x201c;scrupulous care in handling&#x201d; a primary source&#x2014;broke the <i>Description</i> into fragments, rather than considering it as a whole or its author&#x2019;s literary practices.7<br><br>While the Africanists were arguing, a new generation arose of post-colonial readers of al-Hasan al-Wazzan. Most important was Oumel-banine Zhiri, whose own travels took her from her native Morocco to France to the United States. Her 1991 book, <i>L&#x2019;Afrique au miroir de l&#x2019;Europe: Fortunes de Jean L�on l&#x2019;Africain � la Renaissance</i>, sh...</p><h2>The Mystery of the Blue Train: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)</h2><p>Bound for the Riviera, detective Hercule Poirot has boarded Le Train Bleu, an elegant, leisurely means of travel, free of intrigue.

She achieved wide popularity with <i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</i> (1926) and produced a total of eighty novels and short-story collections over six decades. Twenty-four of Christie's best whodunits are now available from Black Dog &amp; Leventhal as part of their bestselling hardcover Agatha Christie Collection.</p><h2>The Waiting Years</h2><p>The beautiful, immature girl whom she took home to her husband was a maid only in name. Tomo's real mission had been to find him a mistress. Nor did her secret humiliation end there. The web that his insatiable lust spun about him soon trapped another young woman, and another ... and the relationships between the women thus caught were to form, over the years, a subtle, shifting pattern in which they all played a part. There was Suga, the innocent, introspective girl from a respectable but impoverished family; the outgoing, cheerful, almost boyish Yumi; the flirtatious, seductive Miya, who soon found her father-in-law more dependable as a man than his brutish son.... And at the center, rejected yet dominating them all, the near tragic figure of the wife Tomo, whose passionate heart was always, until that final day, held in check by an old-fashioned code. <br><br>In a series of colorful, unforgettable scenes, Enchi brilliantly handles the human interplay within the ill-fated Shirakawa family. Japan's leading woman novelist and a member of the prestigious Art Academy, she combines a graceful, evocative style that consciously echoes the <em>Tale of Genji</em> with keen insight and an impressive ability to develop her characters over a long period of time. Her work is rooted deep in the female psychology, and it is her women above all-so clearly differentiated yet all so utterly feminine-who live in the memory. With <em>The Waiting Years</em>, a new and important literary figure makes her debut in the Western world.</p><p><br>FUMIKO ENCHI, the daughter of a famous scholar of the Japanese language, was born in Tokyo in 1905. Without completing her studies at the Girls' High School of the Japan Women's University, she left to study drama. Her first play, <em>Banshun Soya</em>, performed at the Tsukiji Little Theater, was a success. At twenty-five she married a journalist, but after the unhappy war period, when all her property was destroyed, she determined to concentrate entirely on writing in order to escape the oppression of domestic life. A short story published in 1952, Himojii Tsukihi, was acclaimed by the critics and won the coveted Women Writers Prize. With illness and the psychological stresses of middle age, her writing took on an acute realism which set it apart from the subdued tones of traditional Japanese writing. On the publication in 1957 of <em>The Waiting Years</em>-a novel she took eight years to write-she won Japan's highest literary award, the Noma Prize, and is now a member of the Art Academy.<br>"To call the girl a concubine would be making too much of it," he had said to Tomo. "She'll be a maid for you, too... It's a good idea, surely, to have a young woman with a pleasant disposition about the house so that you can train her to look after things for you when you're out calling. That's why I don't want to lower the tone of the household by bringing in a geisha or some other woman of that type. I trust you, and I leave everything to you, so use your good sense to find a young--as far as possible inexperienced--girl. Here, use this for your expenses." <p>He had set before her an astonishingly large sum of money. </p><p>Until then she had managed by pretending not to hear what others said, but there was no avoiding the issue now that Shirakawa himself had broached it with her. Should she refuse to accept the task it was almost certain that her husband would simply introduce into the family a woman chosen without consulting her. His leaving the choice to her was a sign of his trust, of the importance he attached, for the family's sake, to her position. A sense of this odd trust that was reposed in her had been there all the while, heavy in her heart, as she, with Yoshi and Etsuko, who felt nothing but joy at this chance to see the capital, sat swaying in the rickshaws that had brought them all the way to the Kusumis' house in far-off Tokyo. </p><p>"I quite understand," said Kin. "There's a woman I'm friendly with who keeps a notion store and often acts as a go-between in this kind of thing, so I'll ask her right away." </p><p>Kin carried things forward on a businesslike basis, skillfully avoiding any direct reference to the private heaviness of Tomo's heart. Born into a family that had been official rice agents in Kuramae where the Shogun had his warehouses, Kin was well acquainted with the manners of the wealthier merchants and samurai of the old feudal era and was not in the least shocked by the idea that a man who had got on in the world should keep a concubine or even two. As she saw things, the jealousy of a wife in such a situation would be modified by a natural pride in such a sign of the family's increasing prosperity.</p></p><h2>The Chinese Shawl (A Miss Silver Mystery)</h2><p>Traveling to war-torn London to collect her inheritance, Laura Fane falls in love with a wounded RAF pilot and incites the jealousy of a wicked cousin, and when the pilot is murdered, Laura turns to Miss Silver for help. Reissue.</p><p><b>Patricia Wentworth </b>(1878&#x2013;1961) was one of the masters of classic English mystery writing. Born in India as Dora Amy Elles, she began writing after the death of her first husband, publishing her first novel in 1910. In the 1920s, she introduced the character who would make her famous: Miss Maud Silver, the former governess whose stout figure, fondness for Tennyson, and passion for knitting served to disguise a keen intellect. Along with Agatha Christie&#x2019;s Miss Marple, Miss Silver is the definitive embodiment of the English style of cozy mysteries.&#x201c;Miss Silver has her place in detective fiction as surely as Lord Peter Wimsey or Hercule Poirot.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Manchester Evening News </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Patricia Wentworth has created a great detective in Miss Silver, the little old lady who nobody notices, but who in turn notices everything.&#x201d; &#x2014;Paula Gosling, author of the Jack Stryker mystery series&nbsp;&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go wrong with Miss Maud Silver.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Observer</i></p><h2>Without Warning: A Thriller</h2><p><p><b>A SMALL-TOWN TRAGEDY</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Years ago, Katie Sanford's husband was convicted of the murder of Jenny Robbins, then died himself in prison.

He and his wife live in Maine with the twenty-seven golden retrievers they've rescued and rehabilitated over the years.</p>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The dam broke at three AM, four hours after the storm hit. Fortunately, only the North Dam was affected, leaving the other two intact. Had they been breached as well, the eighteen thousand residents of Wilton, Maine, would be former residents of a town that no longer existed. <br>The destruction came as a surprise to everyone, especially the engineers that had certified the dams as &#x201c;low risk&#x201d; just eighteen months before. Certainly Hurricane Nicholas was a powerful storm, especially for early August, but no more so than others that had struck the area in recent years. <br>But the dam completely came apart from the pressure and flooded the areas in Wilton it had sworn to protect. Because it was the least important dam of the three, this meant that three streets on the outskirts of Wilton were flooded and badly damaged, as was the park and the small, private airport. <br>The only citizen to lose his life was seventy-three-year-old Warren Simpson, who suffered a heart attack during the chaotic evacuation process. He was flown to Bangor Hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival. <br>The people of Wilton were resilient and had no doubt they would bounce back from the storm damage. It would cost money and take time, but the town whose charter had been ratified in eighteen forty-eight made plans to persevere and overcome. <br>Of course, they had no idea what was coming. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>I have a lot of anniversaries. I try not to pay attention to them, but sometimes it&#x2019;s hard. Dates are everywhere, from the TV when you switch channels, to the front of cell phones. <br>March thirty-first is my birthday. January fourteenth is the day that Jenny and I were married. September seventeenth is the day I joined the force. April first is the day I was promoted and officially became Chief Jake Robbins. My real name is Jason Robbins, but how Jason became Jake is a puzzle my parents never adequately explained. <br>August seventh is the day Jenny was murdered; I try not to change channels or look at my cell phone that day. <br>Of course, there are some anniversaries whose actual date I don&#x2019;t even know. For instance, I have no idea when I got to Afghanistan, or when I left. I don&#x2019;t have a clue when our old friend Katie Sanford introduced us to Roger Hagel, the guy she would eventually marry. Nor do I know the date that Jenny and I first went out with them, although I do remember that the four of us went bowling and then to dinner. <br>While I know the date Roger murdered Jenny, and even know that it happened at 3:00 PM, I don&#x2019;t know the date he was convicted, nor the date a few months later when he was murdered in prison. I know that I learned of their affair on June nineteenth, but I don&#x2019;t know exactly when it began. <br>I was tempted to leave Wilton after Jenny died, but I never took any action toward that end. I had the job I always wanted, more good friends than I could ever need, and was living in a town that I liked a great deal. For a person who never had much of an interest in putting down roots, I somehow found myself rooted. <br>All I didn&#x2019;t have was Jenny, but no matter where I went, she would never be with me. Roger Hagel saw to that. <br>Pretty much everything in Wilton reminds me of Jenny, but that&#x2019;s okay. I want to remember her, the good times and the bad. Especially the good. <br>So I stayed, and life went on. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Tara Productions, Inc. <br></p><h2>Shaman Sings, The</h2><p>Daisy Perika has no place in the modern world of cold, rational science.

An old threat, actually. Aged warrior Cohen the Barbarian has decided to go out with a bang and take the gods with him. So, with the remnants of his geriatric Silver Horde, he's climbing to the divine retirement home Dunmanifestin with the Discworld equivalent of a nuke--a fifty-pound keg of Agatean Thunder Clay.</p><p> This will, for excellent magical reasons, destroy the world.</p><p> It's up to Leonard of Quirm, Discworld's da Vinci, to invent the technology that might just beat Cohen to his goal.

As Pratchett puts it, <i>The Last Hero</i> "has an extra dimension: some parts of it are written in paint!" New characters include Evil Dark Lord Harry Dread, who started out with "just two lads and his Shed of Doom," and a god so tiresome that his worshippers are forbidden chocolate, ginger, mushrooms <i>and</i> garlic.</p><p> Pratchett's story alone is strong and effective, with several hair-raising <i>frissons</i> contrasting with high comedy; Kidby's paintings make it something very special.

This "lost gospel," the Gospel of Thomas, was written at the same time as the canonical Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and is now considered one of the greatest religious discoveries of the twentieth century. It contains 150 sayings, approximately half of which are found in the New Testament&#x2014;the other half of which are found only here. These new sayings offer an original perspective on Jesus' message. Most notably, they emphasize that the Kingdom of Heaven exists right before us in this present moment, and all that we have to do is recognize it.

Ben Collier has just arrived from wartorn Europe to find that his brother, Daniel, has died in mysterious circumstances. Why would a man with a beautiful wife, a successful career in the movies, and a heroic past choose to kill himself? </p><p> Determined to uncover the truth, Ben enters the maze of the studio system and the uneasy world beneath the glossy shine of the movie business. For this is the moment when politics and the dream factories are beginning to collide as Communist witch hunts render the biggest stars and star makers vulnerable. Even here, where the devastation of Europe seems no more real than a painted movie set, the war casts long and dangerous shadows. When Ben learns troubling facts about his own family's past, he is caught in the middle of a web of deception that shakes his moral foundation to its core. </p><p> Rich with atmosphere and period detail, <i>Stardust</i> flawlessly blends fact and fiction into a haunting thriller evoking both the glory days of the movies and the emergence of a dark strain of American political life. It brilliantly proves why Joseph Kanon has been hailed as the "heir apparent to Graham Greene" (<i>The Boston Globe</i>).</p></p><p><b>Joseph Kanon</b> is the author of four other novels, <i>Los Alamos, The Good German, The Prodigal Spy </i>and <i>Alibi.</i>&nbsp; Before becoming a full-time writer, he was a book publishing executive. He lives in New York City. <p></p><b>A MAN RIDES INTO TOWN</b> <br> <br> <p> AS IT HAPPENED, Sol Lasner was also on the train. Ben spied him first on the red carpet at Grand Central posing for photographers, like one of his stars. Shorter than Ben remembered, his barrel chest wobbling on thin legs, storklike, but with the same tailored look, natty. He gave a quick, obligatory smile to the flashbulbs, then herded a group of men in suits onto the train, back to business. At Croton, where they switched over to the steam engine, most of the suits got off for the ride back to the city, but two stayed on through dinner, so Ben didn't have a chance to talk to him until they were past Albany, when the landscape had already turned dark and there was nothing to observe from the observation car but blurs of street lamps and platform lights streaking past. </p><p> He'd been sitting near the rounded back of the car, smoking and staring out at nothing, when Lasner came in, holding a cigar. He nodded to Ben, not recognizing him, and for a moment Ben was tempted to let it wait, talk later on the Army's time. The next few days were supposed to be his, little shrouds of time to wrap himself up in, prepare for the funeral, stare out windows, get used to it. </p><p> The long-distance call to Danny's wife has taken hours to put through, her voice scratchy with bad connections, or grief. What kind of accident? "A fall. It's in the papers as an accident. You know, anyone can fall. So they put it in that way." But it wasn't? Ben had asked, disconcerted, feeling his way, listening to the precious seconds tick by. "Look," she'd said finally, "you should know. You're his only family," but then went quiet again. You mean he tried to take his life? "Take his life?" she'd said, confusing him until he realized that it was a translation problem, an idiom she hadn't picked up. Hans Ostermann's daughter. Tried to kill himself, he said. "Yes," she said reluctantly, then drew a breath, moving past it. "But they didn't want to say. You know what it's like here. Everything for the good name. Nothing bad ever happens. It's better if it's an accident, in the papers. So I said it, too." There was a snort of air, like a shrug over the phone. "But his brother -- you have a right." </p><p> Rambling on, making no sense to him now, or maybe he had just stopped listening, his head dizzy with it. Not a crash, a virus, some act of fate, but something willed, a scream of unhappiness. "I'm sorry for this news," she'd said before he could ask more. "Is it possible for you to come now? He's in a coma. So still alive. I don't know how long. They don't expect -- so if you could come." And then the reserved time was running out, and instead of questions there were logistics and plans. But what answers could anyone have? Something that only made sense to Danny, the most private act there was. </p><p> To his surprise, there had been no problem having the Army move up the trip. The problem was getting there, with the trains the way they were. Then something last minute opened up on the Chief, if he was willing to sleep sitting up on the Century to meet it, so he'd packed a duffel, sent the wire, and now found himself riding with Sol Lasner. Who could wait -- the Army's assignment -- while he took his personal leave, brooding. Days to think about it, all the way to California. Meanwhile, Lasner was lighting the cigar, looking out the window and then at his watch, checking some invisible schedule. </p><p> "Any idea where we are?" </p><p> "Just past Schenectady." </p><p> Lasner drew on the cigar, looking out again. "Upstate," he said. "Goldwyn's from here. Gloversville. They made gloves. That's what he was, a glove man. Well, why not?" </p><p> Just talking to himself, not really expecting a reply, but suddenly Ben took the opening anyway. The meeting had fallen into his lap, personal leave or not. </p><p> "Mr. Lasner?" </p><p> Lasner turned, peering at him. </p><p> "Sorry. You probably don't remember. We met last month overseas, on the Army trip. Ben Collier." He held out his hand. "I was one of the liaison officers. Translator." </p><p> Lasner took his hand, looking closely, still trying to place him. "The guy with the rooms, right? The one got Eddie Mannix the Ritz in Paris." </p><p> Ben smiled. "And Zanuck. And Balaban. Colonel Mitchell arranged it. He figured they'd want the Ritz. Kind of people used to it." </p><p> "I got news for you," Lasner said, pointing with the cigar. "You think Harry Cohn's used to the Ritz? Some hot-sheet place down on Flower -- that's what he's used to." He shook his head. "I still don't know what that trip was. A stunt. Army puts a bunch of us in uniform, takes us around. What did they get out of it?" </p><p> What did they? Harry Cohn played poker in his suite, ignoring Paris. Everywhere the jockeying for the best hotel rooms, the special transports. Ben remembered the winding road up to Berchtesgaden, lined with jeeps, a new tourist attraction, GIs hunting for souvenirs while the executives stood at Hitler's vast picture window, little tyrants finally humbled. A ride on Hitler's yacht. Hamburg, where people had melted into the pavement during the firebombing. The camps, even worse. A few survivors still there, too emaciated and stunned to be moved. In town, packs of children, foraging. How much had they seen from their requisitioned rooms? </p><p> "It was Ike's idea. Thinks people should see it. What happened. So the State Department sends groups over. That was the studio tour. There was another for the newsreel editors. See what it's like." </p><p> "At the Ritz." </p><p> "And Dachau." </p><p> For a moment there was no sound but the click of wheels beneath them. </p><p> "I was there," Ben said quietly. Watching Lasner stagger against a building, his face in his hands, sobbing. "I know it made an impression on you." </p><p> Lasner rounded his cigar in the stand-up tray, smoothing off the ash. </p><p> "We're making a picture about it." </p><p> "Who's making?" </p><p> "I'm in the Signal Corps. We shot film there. What the newsreels didn't." </p><p> "You personally?" </p><p> "No, I collect the film. See it's put together for briefings, whether we can do something more. Information length, maybe features. If not, V shorts. Depending on the footage. What you do, in a way. Produce." </p><p> Lasner waved his hand. "And now you're out of a job." </p><p> "Not yet. <i>The Battle of San Pietro</i> got a lot of play. And the Tokyo film did okay on general release, so the exhibitors are still interested. And there's Ike's film coming." </p><p> "Who's releasing?" Lasner said quickly. </p><p> "Columbia." </p><p> Lasner grunted. </p><p> "You know how it works. War Activities Committee -- Freeman, at Paramount -- assigns the pictures on a rotating basis. All the majors. It was Columbia's turn." </p><p> "The majors. What am I? They still think Continental's a Poverty Row shop? Next year, we'll outgross RKO, but me they give the training films. You know what it costs me? We get four to five thousand a reel. But we throw in the production, the overhead, the <i>salaries</i> for chrissake. Add it up, it's more like seven thousand a reel and we just eat the difference." He tapped the cigar again, calmer. "Not that I mind. You know, for the war. But you don't hear Freeman calling me with a feature, either." </p><p> "He will be." </p><p> Lasner glanced up at him. "What's this, a pitch?" </p><p> Ben leaned forward. "We're sitting on a ton of footage. They're setting up trials. This is what they're all about. People need to see this. We want to work with a studio to put it together." </p><p> Lasner shook his head. "Let Columbia do it. You think people want to see this? Nobody wants to see this." </p><p> "They should." </p><p> "Should. You know, Freeman asks, it doesn't mean we have to do it. These war films -- it's all strictly voluntary. And now, <i>after</i> the war? Nobody's going to make this picture." </p><p> "I thought you'd want to." </p><p> Lasner looked at him for a long minute, then sighed. </p><p> "Let me tell you something. Nobody needs a picture about killing Jews. What else have they been doing? Since forever." </p><p> "Not like this," Ben said quietly, so that Lasner busied himself putting the cigar out, avoiding him. </p><p> "Wonderful," he said finally. "Cohn gets Eisenhower and I get -- I'll think about it. Let Freeman call. We'll see." A dodge. </p><p> "I'll be at the Signal Corps base in Culver City. A local call." </p><p> "Fort Roach." He caught Ben's look. "Hal Roach's old studio. The Army took it over. They've got some of my people down there. Drafted. My best cutter. Splicing film on VD. How does your prick look with crabs. Talk about a waste of a good technician." He glanced up. "You want to make the picture there? Fort Roach?" </p><p> "No, I want to make it at Continental. With you." </p><p> "Because we were such good pals in Germany. Looking at things." </p><p> "Freeman said you were the first call to make. You were there for the Relief Fund. You hired refugees in 'forty. You -- " </p><p> "So back to the well." </p><p> "He said the others think they're Republicans." </p><p> Lasner snorted. "Since when did Frank get funny? If I heard two cracks from him my whole life it's a lot." He shook his head, then snorted again. "Mayer keeps a picture of Hoover in his office. Hoover. And now with the horses. A Jew with horses. So he's fooling everybody." He paused. "Don't push me on this. We'll talk. In an office. We make a picture if it makes sense to make a picture. Not just someone tells me it's good for the Jews. Anyway, what kind of name is Collier?" </p><p> Ben smiled. "From Kohler. My father. It means the same thing." </p><p> "So why change it? Who changes names? Actors." </p><p> "My mother. After the divorce, we went to England. She wanted us to have English names. My father stayed in Germany." </p><p> "Stayed?" </p><p> "He was a <i>Mischling.</i> Half." </p><p> "And that saved him?" </p><p> "He thought it would." </p><p> Lasner looked away. "I'm sorry. So it's personal with you? That's no good, you know, in pictures. You get things mixed up." </p><p> "Not personal that way. I just want to get this done and get out of the Army. Same as everybody." </p><p> Lasner picked up the cigar again and lit it, settling in. </p><p> "Why'd you pick the Signal Corps?" </p><p> "Th...</p></p><h2>The Blood of Abraham: Insights into the Middle East</h2><p>The former president and architect of the Camp David Accords elucidates the historical and political background of Middle East enmities and presents an analysis of the structure of tensions and conflicting points of view of today</p><p>A popular history of the Middle East, now updatedSince his earliest days in the White House, Jimmy Carter has demonstrated an untiring passion for pursuing peace in the Middle East. His formation of the Carter Center and his continuing prominent role in world affairs has done nothing to dampen that passion. In this new edition with an updated afterword and chronology, President Carter demystifies the history of the political expectations of each nation in the Middle East, the reasons for their different goals, and the nature of their prime concerns. His landmark study provides an enlightened and reconciling vision for all?Jews, Muslims, and Christians?who share the blood of Abraham.</p><h2>Every Book Its Reader: The Power of the Printed Word to Stir the World</h2><p><p>Inspired by a landmark exhibition mounted by the British Museum in 1963 to celebrate five eventful centuries of the printed word, Nicholas A. Basbanes offers a lively consideration of writings that have "made things happen" in the world, works that have both nudged the course of history and fired the imagination of countless influential people.</p><p>In his fifth work to examine a specific aspect of book culture, Basbanes also asks what we can know about such figures as John Milton, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Adams, Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, Henry James, Thomas Edison, Helen Keller -- even the notorious Marquis de Sade and Adolf Hitler -- by knowing what they have read. He shows how books that many of these people have consulted, in some cases annotated with their marginal notes, can offer tantalizing clues to the evolution of their character and the development of their thought.</p><p>Taking the concept one step further, Basbanes profiles some of the most articulate readers of our time -- David McCullough, Harold Bloom, Robert Fagles, Robert Coles, Helen Vendler, Elaine Pagels, Daniel Aaron, Christopher Ricks, Matthew Bruccoli, and Perri Klass among them -- who discuss such relevant concepts as literary canons, classic works in translation, the timelessness of poetry, the formation of sacred texts, and the power of literature to train physicians, nurture children, and rehabilitate criminal offenders.</p><p>"Basbanes has a deep and abiding passion for books -- a joyful addiction," Dan Smith wrote in the <em>Toronto Star of Patience &amp; Fortitude</em>, characterizing his body of work as "part travelogue, part scholarship, and all story." The tradition continues with <em>Every Book Its Reader</em>.</p></p><p><p>Nicholas A. Basbanes has worked as an award-winning investigative reporter, a literary editor, and a nationally syndicated columnist. The author of five books, he also writes a regular column for <em>Fine Books &amp; Collections</em> magazine and lectures widely on book-related issues. He and his wife, Constance, live in Massachusetts.</p>As in <i>A Gentle Madness </i>and other books, syndicated columnist Basbanes again proves his fascination with the minutiae of bibliophilia, relating with relish how many volumes were in various famous readers' collections, who wrote in their margins, who kept commonplace books, and other book-related ephemera before getting to the heart of this book: his discussions with well-known readers of today. These include Harold Bloom on Shakespeare and the politicizing of literature in the academy; Helen Vendler on her experience of poetry from adolescence on; and the impressive Robert Coles on his literary relationships with writers such as William Carlos Williams and Walker Percy, as well as his own call to action for children around the world. This volume is like a pot in an overenthusiastic cook's kitchen: a little bit of everything has been thrown in. As in cooking, however, too many notes spoil the palate. Basbanes writes fluidly and there are intriguing tidbits&#x2014;the chapter on the development of religious texts is especially strong&#x2014;but the book as a whole has no central argument or philosophy to make it cohere.

He lives in Wisconsin. This is his first book.<b>Chapter 1: Winter</b> <p> I arrive at Heimo Korth's cabin on the Old Crow drainage in the far northeastern corner of Alaska in early January 2002 after a three-hour, 300-mile flight from Fairbanks. Although I expected stomach-churning air currents, the flight was a smooth one, and the two-seater 1954 Cessna 170B skids to an easy stop in a tundra field two feet deep in snow. In the Alaskan bush, the plane functions as a time machine, and only thirty minutes outside of Fairbanks, Rick, the bush pilot, and I had left behind civilization. Even the seismic lines, slashed across the countryside during decades of oil exploration, disappeared. For the next two and a half hours, there was not even a building to mar the harsh beauty of the Alaskan winter, and I had the feeling that I was being transported straight back into the nineteenth century. </p><p> "Heimo and his family are the only subsistence family I know," Rick said as we crossed Stranglewoman Creek. "'Subsistence' gets a lot of lip service in Alaska, but the Korths live almost strictly off the land. You got to respect them for that. Hell, their closest neighbor is a hundred miles downriver on the Porcupine." </p><p> Looking out the window at the endless sweep of land, at the trees bent double under the weight of snow, and the cow moose bedded down in the frozen creek bed, I tried to imagine it: New York City to Philadelphia; Chicago to Milwaukee; Los Angeles to San Diego -- not a soul in between. </p><p> Heimo heard the plane approaching -- in the Arctic winter, when stillness is nearly absolute, sounds are magnified -- and he is at the runway waiting for us. </p><p> I have not seen Heimo in twenty-seven years, and I've been imagining this day since the previous summer when Heimo was in Fort Yukon and he and I worked out the details of my visit by phone. I zip up my coat, pull my fleece hat over my ears, and pop open the door. Squeezing out of the seat, I nearly fall from the plane. But my reunion with Heimo will have to wait. First we unload the plane, and then we outfit the wings and engine with insulated covers to keep them warm and ice-free for the hour that Rick will be on the ground. </p><p> Once the work is finished, it is time for greetings. Rick and Heimo shake hands and discuss the weather -- in winter Alaskans are at the mercy of Mother Nature, and the talk is often of temperature, snow, wind, ice. I listen and look on. Heimo wears canvas pants with gleaming, blue vinyl kneepads, moose-and-caribou-hide mukluks with wolf trim and sealskin liners, thick beaver mitts, and a canvas parka with a wolverine ruff and seams held together by bright white dental floss. Dental floss is stronger than sewing thread. Though it may look foolish, over one hundred miles from the nearest neighbor, appearances are apparently something Heimo cares little about. Ice has crystallized in his beard, which he wears like an Amish farmer, long and unruly, with only a faint trace of a mustache. He also wears a wool hat, which sits on his head in a cock-eyed fashion like Randall P. McMurphy, Jack Nicholson's character in <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.</i> </p><p> Heimo comes over to say hi. Even in the cold, he moves like an athlete. "Nice weather we got, eh?" He smiles. "Early January and it's only fifteen below." Then he gestures in the distance at the white peaks of the Brooks Range, which are silhouetted against a faint gray-blue sky that stretches to the horizon. "What do ya think?" he asks. </p><p> "Best backyard in America," I answer. He seems to like my response and shakes my hand heartily. </p><p> Heimo ferries my bags and me back to the cabin in a sled behind his Ski-Doo snowmachine, while Rick waits at the plane until Heimo returns. The trail winds through the tundra, and I bounce around and struggle to hold on until half a mile or so later we come to a stop at a large hollow in the snow colored a faint red by blood. "Shot a moose here in fall time. Called him from a mile away." Heimo simulates the call of a cow moose in estrus looking for a mate, a low bawl of longing, a groaning, "awhhhh, awhhhh" like a fishing boat's foghorn. "I hid behind that tree," Heimo says, stuttering slightly, the same stutter he had as a teen who spent more time in the woods hunting, trapping, and identifying birds than he did in the classroom. He points to a weary-looking black spruce no thicker than a child's ankle surrounded by snow-topped tussocks. "Moose can't see very good. They can smell, but their eyes ain't very good. The big bull came in swinging his horns, lookin' for a cow. Dropped him with one shot. Best thing about it was I didn't have to pack him out. I was only a quarter of a mile from the cabin." </p><p> We cut through a maze of willows and then dip down into a creek bed. After a quarter of a mile we climb the creek bank and Heimo stops the snowmachine. "See that," he says, pointing out an area where it looks as if a team of sled dogs has been urinating for days. Deep yellow holes pockmark the snow. But I know that Heimo doesn't run dogs. "That's where you dump your honeybucket," he says, clearing up my confusion. The honeybucket is an essential fixture of the Alaskan bush, usually a five-gallon plastic pail, though just about anything will do in a pinch, in which people relieve themselves at night when it's too cold to make a trip outside. In winter, at 30 and 40 below, the honeybucket is a savior. Extending his arm in the direction of an orange tent nestled among a stand of black spruce, he says, "And there's your place -- the Arctic oven." The ten-foot by ten-foot double-walled tent outfitted with a small woodstove is to be my home away from home for the next three and a half weeks. </p><p> Heimo helps me get my gear into the tent, and then he shows me how to operate the woodstove. He lights a fire and then adjusts the stove's vents. After the fire is crackling, he leaves. I sit on my cot as close to the stove as I can, trying to absorb the heat. After I warm up, I arrange my gear quickly, walk outside the tent, zip the double fly, and follow a trail that leads away from the creek. Forty yards down, I discover the cabin, sitting at the base of a hill, concealed on three sides by a cluster of top-heavy spruce trees. Roger Kaye, a twenty-six-year veteran of the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service, informed me of Heimo's tendency to hide his cabins. "Trappers are a paranoid bunch in general," Roger said, "but there's nobody who tucks his cabins away like Heimo." I can see what Roger meant. I could have walked the creek not more than a stone's throw away and never noticed the cabin at all had it not been for the sweet, comforting smell of woodsmoke. </p><p> Compared to the cabins I've seen farther south in Alaska, where builders have larger trees to work with, Heimo's looks unassuming, even frail, as if a polar wind or the Big Bad Wolf could do considerable damage. The wall logs are thin and chinked with moss. Moss covers the roof, too. The cabin's obvious asset is its location. To the north thick black spruce and to the south a 1,000-foot hill protect it from the frigid winds that pummel this landscape. Twenty feet from the cabin, a winter's supply of cordwood is stacked neatly, and snowshoes and an exterior-frame backpack lean against the woodpile. A moose leg lies suspended between two roughly fashioned sawhorses. Bags of furs and leghold traps hang from racks and caribou antlers, and the foreleg of a caribou rests against the cabin's front wall near a metal washtub. Another caribou flank hangs from a tree branch. Boreal chickadees peck at it, leaving a dusting of reddish brown flesh on the snow. Two willow ptarmigan swing from a string that has been tied around a roof pole, and propped against the cabin wall are an ice pick, a scoop shovel, and two iron rakes. A second snowmachine sits idle behind the cabin near the meat cache. </p><p> Heimo is standing outside the cabin's front door. "Come on, warm up," he says, inviting me in. "You can look around later." He ducks in through the shoulder-high doorway, which is cut small to conserve the cabin's heat, and removes a wool blanket draped across the opening. I follow, bending deeply at the waist. </p><p> Heimo introduces me to Edna, his wife, who is kneeling by the woodstove, frying bread in a cast-iron skillet. Edna rises quietly and shakes my hand. She has broad, high cheekbones, a strong, muscular jaw, braided raven-black hair, and dark Mongolian eyes. She is Eskimo, a Siberian Yupik Eskimo from St. Lawrence Island, an island of rock and lava stranded in the middle of the Bering Sea, 120 miles off the west coast of Alaska, forty miles from Siberia's Chukchi Peninsula. </p><p> Heimo then introduces me to his youngest daughter, Krin, who sits in the corner of the cabin, watching me intently. When I approach she looks down at a notebook and begins scribbling. "What kind of greeting is that?" Heimo asks her. Krin stands and shakes my hand and smiles shyly. She has almond-shaped eyes, Heimo's angular nose, and Edna's lovely cheekbones and complexion. Nearly as tall as Heimo, she is a willowy twelve-year-old with long legs and arms. Edna invites me to sit down, and Krin returns her attention to her notebook. Since there are no chairs in the cabin, I sit on a bucket near the simple sheet-metal woodstove, and Edna hands me two sandwiches of fry bread and cheese. Heimo grabs a piece of bread and explains that his eldest daughter, Rhonda, is still out on the trapline. Then, suddenly, he jumps, as if he's been shocked by an electric fence. "Oh shit!" he exclaims, lunging for the door. "I forgot about Rick. He's gonna be pissed. He's gonna think I'm screwin' with him." </p><p> The cabin is no larger than a conventional suburban kitchen, ten by sixteen, four steps across, six and a half steps long, necessarily small in a climate where heat is precious. Sitting on the bucket, I remember what bush pilot Kirk Sweetsir, who was raised in the Yukon River village of Ruby, 450 miles downriver from Fort Yukon, said about the Korths. "You visit Heimo and Edna's place and there stuff amounts to nothing. Theirs is not a sedentary life. Their lifestyle reflects an awareness that life in the Arctic exists on the m...</p></p><h2>Soul of Nowhere: Traversing Grace in a Rugged Land</h2><p>A naturalist&#39;s physical and philosophical exploration of the American southwest considers such regions as the Sierra Madre Mountains, the canyons of Utah, the White Mountain Apache Reservation, and a deserted island in the Sea of Cortez.</p><p>Craig Childs--naturalist, adventurer, desert ecologist, and freqent contributor to National Public Radio&#39;s Morning Edition--lives in Crawford, Colorado. His previous books include The Secret Knowledge of Water and Crossing Paths.From the labyrinthine slot canyons of Utah to the deserted island beaches in the Sea of Cortes, the arid lands of the Southwest speak to the acclaimed naturalist Childs. Possessing an extraordinary sense of harmony with these forbidding landscapes, Childs translates their primal voices into a taut and unsentimental narrative of exploration. Step by arduous step, readers follow Childs into the desert's severe mysteries, penetrating deep into regions once home to the cliff dwellers of Salado pre-history and the giants of Seri legend. His intrepid fellow adventurers--a maverick mathematician, a traumatized social worker, a pagan mechanic--mirror Craig's own fierce ardor for stark beauty and fearful silence. Like the ancient ones who inscribed the cliffs with enigmatic spirals, these modern invaders of the dry wilderness probe insatiably into its hidden secrets, fighting their way up sheer cliffs, enduring the unexpected snowstorm, crawling through treacherous mazes. But ultimately all merely human strivings yield to the stark monoliths, the startling waterfalls, and the bleak crevices of a timeless land that embraces and then overshadows all who fall under its spell. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Through his own lively and eloquent reminiscences, <i>Stepping Stones </i>retraces the poet&#x2019;s steps from his first exploratory testing of the ground as an infant to what he called his &#x201c;moon-walk&#x201d; to the podium to receive the 1995 Nobel Prize in Literature. It also fascinatingly charts his post-Nobel life and is supplemented with a number of photographs, many from the Heaney family album and published here for the first time. In response to firm but subtle questioning from Dennis O&#x2019;Driscoll, Heaney sheds a personal light on his work (poems, essays, translations, plays) and on the artistic and ethical challenges he faced during the dark years of the Ulster Troubles. Combining the spontaneity of animated conversation with the considered qualities of the best autobiographical writing, <i>Stepping Stones </i>provides an original, diverting, and absorbing store of reflections and recollections. Scholars and general readers alike are brought closer to the work, life, and creative development of a charismatic and lavishly gifted poet whose latest collection, <i>District and Circle</i>, was awarded the T. S. Eliot Prize in 2007.</p><p>Dennis O'Driscoll&#x2019;s previous publications include <i>New and Selected Poems </i>and <i>Reality Check</i>. He is the author of a collection of essays and reviews, <i>Troubled Thoughts, Majestic Dreams</i>, and works as a civil servant in Dublin.<p>Introduction</p><p>&#x2018;A wise man&#x2019;s wisdom needs to be extracted&#x2019;, Bertolt Brecht remarks in his poem about the cross-examining Customs man who seizes on the knowledge which the sage Lao Tsu is smuggling into exile. On 9 September 2001, Seamus Heaney called to my office in the International Branch of Irish Customs, around the corner from Dublin Castle, once the centre of English power in Ireland and now the powerhouse of Ireland&#x2019;s Revenue and Customs service. In my cramped room, at the end of the long, low, crepuscular corridor &#x2013; resembling a smugglers&#x2019; tunnel more than the fifth-floor passageway of a modern office block &#x2013; Heaney, having already agreed in principle to an interview book I had proposed by letter (citing auspicious precedents: <i>Conversations with Czeslaw Milosz</i>, Vaclav Havel&#x2019;s <i>Disturbing the Peace, Eug�ne Guillevic&#x2019;s Living in Poetry</i>), elaborated on his ideas for the project. It cannot have been easy for him to face an extensive series of interviews, knowing that this would add further pressures to a life in which literary acclaim has been accompanied by massive claims on his time. </p><p>Had he inclined towards refusal, I would not have pursued the matter. Having witnessed for myself the daily arrival by green An Post van of a sackful of requests, invitations, proofs, academic enquiries, personal letters, manuscripts-in-progress and glossy new books, to a house where neither phone nor fax enjoys a moment&#x2019;s respite, I knew he had strong grounds for hesitation. His presence at a book launch, his speech at an art-gallery opening, his place at a Friday-night dinner table; his reading, his lecture, his review, his blurb, his oration, his nomination, his reaction to some public event &#x2013; everyone has plans that involve snatching him away from his poems. </p><p>Now here I was, embarking on a project which would encroach on his dream time even further. What I told myself in mitigation, and what I hope this book bears out, is that a volume of linked interviews with Seamus Heaney would be a substantial addition to his oeuvre rather than merely a subtraction and distraction. Moreover, I decided from the start not to propose, let alone impose, any deadline for completion of the book. The priority for the poet must be his poetry; and the poetry must determine the agenda and dictate the deadline. Happily, it was during the years in which this book was under way that Heaney wrote virtually all of the poems in <i>District and Circle</i> (2006). Some poems (&#x2018;Anahorish 1944&#x2019;, &#x2018;Tate&#x2019;s Avenue&#x2019; and &#x2018;Home Help&#x2019;, for instance) drew their initial inspiration from the ongoing interviews; others were excerpted directly from Chapter 8 as the opening sections of &#x2018;Found Prose&#x2019; and &#x2018;Out of This World&#x2019;. As more recent poems also began to emanate from these interviews, Heaney referred to the book as &#x2018;a potent stirrer-up of memories&#x2019;. Poems apart, <i>The Burial at Thebes</i>, his version of Sophocles&#x2019; <i>Antigone</i>, opened in the Abbey Theatre, Dublin in 2004; <i>Finders Keepers</i>, a generous selection from his lifetime&#x2019;s output of autobiographical and critical prose, was published in 2002; and translations, essays and lectures continued to appear. Not surprisingly, there were lengthy periods when no progress with this book was feasible. </p><p>At Seamus Heaney&#x2019;s own request, the interviews were conducted principally in writing and by post. But &#x2013; at the risk of some small overlap with previous chapters (which are themselves not without unavoidable overlaps) &#x2013; Chapter 15 combines the transcripts of two interviews we recorded (one publicly, the other privately) in Santa Fe, under the auspices of the Lannan Foundation, in October 2003; and several of the remarks relating to <i>District and Circle</i> in Chapter 13 originated on the spacious stage of the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, in April 2006, where I interviewed Heaney before an audience. My original plan had been to visit the poet on a specific day each week to record material which I would then transcribe. However, given the relentless demands he already faced &#x2013; and, until an illness in 2006, his frequent absences on foreign literary and academic travel &#x2013; this was not a practical proposition. </p><p>I therefore began to prepare the written questions and observations which form the basis </p><p>of these interviews. The questions provided &#x2018;multiple choice&#x2019; options in that Heaney could decide which ones to answer and which to ignore, and could rearrange the order in which he responded to them. It would have been unrealistic to expect responses to all of these countless questions: my first set, confined to the themes of childhood and the early writing years, consisted of sixty-two packed pages; many hundreds of additional pages &#x2013; interlaced with question marks &#x2013; would eventually reach the poet who, for all his unfailing patience with this project, must sometimes have questioned his wisdom in laying himself open to such a grand inquisition. </p><p>In the process of working together towards a final text &#x2013; reviewing responses, filling gaps, remedying omissions, adding narrative links, augmenting connective tissue &#x2013; the conversational dimension of the material, though already evident (especially after the opening, orienting chapters), was further heightened. Each suite of questions was either bound by a thematic thread or &#x2013; more usually &#x2013; based around a specific collection of Heaney poems. I wanted to avoid a slavishly chronological approach; collection-centred questions fostered variety and flexibility, allowing for a blend of contemporaneous commentary and retrospective recollection. If this resulted in some anomalies &#x2013; for instance much of Heaney&#x2019;s reminiscence about his secondary schooling precedes the detailed focus on his primary schooling (for which the <i>Station Island</i> chapter presented an appropriate context) &#x2013; it seemed a quirky price worth paying, especially since the pay-off is more true to the manner in which normal conversation loops and meanders, advances and retreats, than any strictly chronological account could hope to be. </p><p>While this book does not therefore conform to biographical convention, the fact that Seamus Heaney has not been the subject of a biography was itself a stimulus to this work. But chronological biographies of famous writers almost inevitably become as predictable as the check-in routines at international airports once the author&#x2019;s gifts have been recognized and he or she is subsumed into the world of honours and awards and intercontinental literary travel. The adoption of a collection-based approach left me free at any stage to ask Heaney (whose books have all included eidetic evocations of childhood) about aspects of his growing up and his development as a writer. To avoid losing contact with the essential inner poet, especially when we touched on the periods in which the &#x2018;smiling public man&#x2019; began striding the literary world, was a constant objective. I tend to think of Seamus Heaney as a poet whose childhood &#x2013; notwithstanding its &#x2018;sorrowing&#x2019; aspects, discussed in this book &#x2013; had its Edenic dimensions: certainty and security, calendar customs and feast days, agrarian cycles and ecclesiastical rites. The wound of expulsion from that tried, tested and trusted world hurt him into a poetry of evocation, yearning and elegy. </p><p>Ian Hamilton, the English critic and poet, regarded Heaney as &#x2018;the most over-interviewed of living poets&#x2019;. Yet what initially prompted me to undertake this book was precisely the opposite view: a conviction that he was under-interviewed in more senses than one. It seemed to me that a major poet who has been a consistently engaging literary interviewee should be encouraged to expound his ideas and expand his recollections beyond the meagre word-counts of a newspaper or literary journal; also, that a broader range of themes should be explored than was usual in the past (when the contents of the latest Heaney publication, or the implications of the Ulster Troubles for his work, were the staple interrogative fare). Aside from a handful of exceptions &#x2013; including the interview by his friend Karl Miller (Between the Lines, 2000) and the Paris Review interview (Fall 1997) by his fellow poet Henri Cole &#x2013; Heaney interviews, though fascinating in themselves, have been too narrow in scope to present a comprehensive portrait of the man and his times. </p><p>Writers are not necessarily articulate simply because language is their stock in trade. If poets spoke poetry, they would not need to write it; if the poems they wrote in the heat of creation attained instant perfection, they would not need to be repeatedly revised, rethought and rewritten. But Seamus Heaney &#x2013; as anyone who has heard him interviewed on radio, or who has been the fortunate addressee of one of his handwritten letters or postcards will know &#x2013; has the rare capacity to improvise sentences which are at once spontaneous and shapely, playful and profound, beautiful and true. The same extemporaneous eloquence is a feature of these interviews. </p><p>While it took some years for the book as a whole to accumulate, the individual tranches tended to be completed very quickly, whenever an opportunity for tranquil recollection unexpectedly presented itself and Heaney could concentrate on a chapter over a few days in Glanmore Cottage. His remarks combine the swiftness and immediacy of an oral interview with the coherent and considered qualities of good autobiographical writing. Patrick Kavanagh &#x2013; among Seamus Heaney&#x2019;s early exemplars as a poet &#x2013; was always tempted as oral interviewee (and indeed when cross-examined in the law courts during the libel action he inadvisedly pressed) towards the impetuous overstatement and the reckless generality; yet even the volatile Kavanagh appreciated the importance of more measured responses: &#x2018;When we &#x2013; or at any rate when I &#x2013; speak impromptuously, we tend to speak on the surface, expressing the surface irritations of the moment. Out of repose the truth springs.&#x2019; A similar point about interviews was made by the more guarded J. M. Coetzee: &#x2018;Truth is related to silence, to reflection, to the practice of <i>writing</i>. Speech is not a fount of truth but a pale and provisional version of writing.&#x2019; </p><p>My own role here is that of prompter rather than interrogator &#x2013; the book was in no sense envisaged to be a &#x2018;tell all&#x2019; account of Seamus Heaney&#x2019;s life. I can think of no compelling reason why writers should feel obliged to discuss publicly the more private and intimate details of their lives or to air material which they plan to explore artistically. Yet never during my interviewing did I sense that he had withheld or suppressed anything that would be of significance to readers; and this is very much a book for readers of his oeuvre, on whose behalf I hope to have asked the kinds of questions which they might themselves have wished to pose. </p><p>The only stipulation made at the outset by the poet was that he would not engage in detailed analytical discussion of individual poems. In this respect, one is reminded again of J. M. Coetzee and also of another Nobel laureate, George Seferis. Alluding to the latter, his translator Edmund Keeley wrote: &#x2018;However accommodating a poet may feel toward a student or critic or interviewer, if he is as wise as George Seferis, he will be reluctant to allow the richness of his work to be restricted by the kind of detailed commentary on specific poems that seems to carry the imprint of the poet&#x2019;s approval, especially if this comment is meant for public consumption . . .&#x2019; J. M. Coetzee, having observed in an interview that the author of his novels &#x2018;either isn&#x2019;t me or is me in a deeper sense than the words I am now speaking are me&#x2019;, warned that any comment he might make on his own work would be &#x2018;said from a position peripheral, posterior to the forever unreclaimable position from which the book was written&#x2019;. </p><p>This book does not pretend to be an authorized &#x2018;reader&#x2019;s guide&#x2019; to Seamus Heaney&#x2019;s poems but rather a survey of his life, often using the poems as reference points. It offers a biographical context for the poems and a poetry-based account of the life. It reviews the life by re-viewing it from the perspective of Heaney&#x2019;s late sixties: a life which has itself been monitored &#x2013; sometimes almost as closely as his books have been reviewed &#x2013; by critics and journalists. Seamus Deane, a friend since their schooldays, recalled &#x2013; in his <i>New Yorker</i> memoir of Heaney &#x2013; that he once sent a letter to the poet &#x2018;with his name in quotation marks on the envelope &#x2013; "Seamus Heaney" &#x2019;: &#x2018;He liked that&#x2019;, Deane went on. &#x2018;But Heaney was aware, too, of the chemistry that alters a writer who has gained fame and transforms him from what he is to what his reputation is.&#x2019; My hope is that this dialogue will go some distance towards unshackling the poet from the quotation marks and releasing him back into an unhampered life of his own: </p><p>And there I was, incredible to myself,</p><p>among people far too eager to believe me </p><p>and my story, even if it happened to be true. </p><p>Little wonder that Seamus Heaney identifies with &#x2018;Borges and I&#x2019;, a &#x2018;parable&#x2019; by Jorge Luis Borges which begins: &#x2018;It&#x2019;s the other one, it&#x2019;s Borges, that things happen to . . . News of Borges reaches me through the mail and I see his name on an academic ballot or in a biographical dictionary.&#x2019; In this book, the &#x2018;other&#x2019; Heaney, the mythologized public figure, is reunited with the Heaney of the first person singular; the &#x2018;intended, complete&#x2019; poet sits down to breakfast with the husband and householder; the artist of Field Work demonstrates the art of saving hay. We see how haphazard the writing process can be for a poet who does not immure himself in an ivory tower, how much the writing has had to compete with the living and breadwinning. </p><p>Seamus Heaney is himself given to the interrogative path to wisdom, in both prose and poetry, never shying from the big existential questions. One of the deepest sources of his profundity as a writer, and one of the characteristics which (along with a gift for recreating childhood epiphanies) he shares with Czeslaw Milosz &#x2013; the poet he identified as the &#x2018;giant at my shoulder&#x2019; &#x2013; is the need to respond to an insistent inner voice which asks &#x2018;What did you do with your life, what did you do?&#x2019; <i>In The Spirit Level</i>, he wonders aloud of an antecedent, the &#x2018;journeyman tailor&#x2019; of &#x2018;At Banagher&#x2019;: &#x2018;Does he ever question what it all amounts to / Or ever will?&#x2019; Similarly, he imagines his brother asking &#x2018;is this all? As it was / In the beginning, is now and shall be?&#x2019; Questions hovering over other collections include &#x2018;What do we say any more / to conjure the salt of our earth?&#x2019;; &#x2018;Where does spirit live?&#x2019;; &#x2018;who&#x2019;s to know / How to read sorrow rightly, or at all?&#x2019; And central to Heaney&#x2019;s endeavours have been the &#x2018;preoccupying questions&#x2019; he raises on the first page of his first volume of prose, <i>Preoccupations</i>: &#x2018;How should a poet properly live and write? What is his relationship to be to his own voice, his own place, his literary heritage and his contemporary world?&#x2019; </p><p>These are among the questions which recur here, explicitly and implicitly, as we follow in Seamus Heaney&#x2019;s footsteps on what he called, in his Nobel Prize speech, &#x2018;a journey into the wideness of language, a journey where each point of arrival &#x2013; whether in one&#x2019;s poetry or one&#x2019;s life &#x2013; turned out to be a stepping stone rather than a destination&#x2019;.

He seems to be writing the poems we all need to read right now.&#34; --Antioch Review Larry Levis was born in Fresno, California, in 1946. His first book of poems, Wrecking Crew, won the United States Award from the International Poetry Forum, and was published in the Pitt Poetry Series in 1972. His second book, The Afterlife, won the Lamont Award from the American Academy of Poets in 1976. In 1981, The Dollmaker&#39;s Ghost was a winner of the Open Competition of the National Poetry Series. Among his other awards were three fellowships in poetry from the National Endowment for the Arts, a Fulbright Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Larry Levis died in 1996.</p><p>These long poems join fragments of past pk events with present-day observations, creating gauzy reveries that lure the reader into the poet's dreamy consciousness. What Levis ( Winter Stars ) sees as he looks back is a life populated with images of blankness and extinction, pointing up that we are merely temporary residents in the void that is existence, "ticking away into / what we can do nothing about." Experience occurs as a series of existential still-lifes, frozen moments in time. Remembering a trip to Oaxaca, Levis recalls the "hush of the mountains above the . . . hush / Of the plaza . . . the / hush that is / Held in paintings the way a breath is held, but held / forever." In another poem, Levis asks what it means to be American. He answers: "It means, mostly, to go unnoticed . . . to type behind a / desk all day where no one / Sees you . . . . To perform your whole life in a silence." If Levis's transitions are sometimes unclear, his images are always pk piquant, particularly the final one of this powerful collection: "Riding beside me, your seat belt around your invisible / waist.

This involved totally renouncing poetry and suppressing her own books. Her poetry - published in Notes on Cafs and Bedrooms (1963) and Iliad of Broken Sentences (1967) - is exuberantly sensuous, a hymn to sixties hedonism set amid the bohemian nighttime world of a London reinvented through French poetic influences and sultry Oriental imagery. All her published poetry is now available in this edition for the first time in over 40 years, along with a selection of her prose. &#34;&#34;A fragrant reopening of a bottle stoppered up forty years ago. As an amplification of the furibund poems that stood out a mile in the sheepish anthologies where they appeared.&#34;&#34;--Poetry &#34;&#34;Tonks was a far superior poet - awesomely sick, wickedly good. . . her ugliness is shot through with vital impropriety, a kind of punk feminism that subtly interrogates the empires of English poetry.&#34;&#34;--Chicago Review &#34;&#34;Tonks consumed the city of London during the bohemian &#39;60s with more elan and euphoria than any British poet of her era.&#34;&#34;--Rain Taxi</p><p>Rosemary Tonks (1928-2014) was a colourful figure in the London literary scene during the 1960s. She published two poetry collections, Notes on Cafes and Bedrooms (Putnam, 1963) and Iliad of Broken Sentences (The Bodley Head, 1967), and six novels, from Opium Fogs (1963) to The Halt During the Chase (1972), wrote for The Observer, The Times, The New York Review of Books, The Listener, The New Statesman and Encounter, and presented poetry programmes for the BBC.Following the death of her mother, a crisis of religious faith, her divorce and nearly losing her sight, she renounced literature, suppressed her own books, left London for Bournemouth and cut herself off from family and friends. After travelling to Jerusalem in 1981 to be baptised by the River Jordan, she created a new identity for herself, her whereabouts known only to family. Thought to be living somewhere as a recluse, she was in fact continuing to inhabit cafes and parks, and was active as a silent, often solitary evangelist working outside any church, giving out Bibles in London and Bournemouth. In 2009 she was the subject of Brian Patten&#39;s BBC radio documentary The Poet Who Vanished. All her published poetry was made available for the first time in over 40 years in Bedouin of the London Evening: Collected Poems, published by Bloodaxe Books in October 2014. This edition also includes a small selection of her prose. A second edition with an expanded introduction and an additional prose piece was issued in 2016.&#39;My reading life has been immeasurably improved by Rosemary Tonks&#39;s Bedouin of the London Evening&#39; - Max Porter, Guardian (Books of the Year 2015); &#39;The poet Rosemary Tonks her name in the 60s and 70s, then withdrew from public sight and published nothing in the later part of her life. Following her recent death, Neil Astley has collected and introduced her work in Bedouin of the London Evening. It&#39;s a highly original collection, mingling savage realism with a surreal fancy, and it restores an essential voice of late-20th-century British poetry to its rightful place.&#39; - Andrew Motion, Guardian (Books of the Year 2014); &#39;The world has waited for this slim volume since 1973...It is important for two reasons. First, we can read again her challenging and original poetry, long out of print; and second, with her devoted present publisher Neil Astley&#39;s excellent introduction, we learn what happened to Tonks...Tonks repays deeper study: densely allusive, self-mocking, richly spiked with insight - and beauty. A great treat. An extreme spirit.&#39; - Caroline Bowder, Church Times (Christmas books); &#39;Between 1963 and 1974, Rosemary Tonks published two collections of poetry as well as novels, short stories and reviews. Then she disappeared... Now, finally, Neil Astley has been able to compile her collected poems. And what a joy they are: sensuous, witty, alternately cool and hot-blooded. Tonks&#39;s verse, perfectly tuned to the life of cities, channels Baudelaire and Rimbaud, but always in her own easy voice.&#39; - New Statesman, NS Recommends; &#39;Her reappearance in this important and well-documented book, which includes two penetrating reviews, a short story and an interview, is the best sort of rediscovery: one that disrupts our sense of poetic continuity even as it restores it.&#39; - Patrick McGuinness, London Review of Books;&#39;...like Plath, Tonks made an extraordinary jump with her second collection, arriving at a confident and utterly distinctive voice. Like Ariel, Iliad seems to open new doors in poetry; like Ariel, the new beginning was also an abrupt end.&#39; - Suzi Feay, Independent on Sunday; &#39;After publishing two seedily glittering books of verse in the 1960s, Rosemary Tonks - who died this year- renounced literature. This exciting collection restores to us a unique oeuvre which evokes the &#39;sofas, fugs and cinemas&#39; of post-war London, as though the French poet Baudeliare had written in a Soho greasy spoon.&#39; - Jeremy Noel-Tod, Sunday Times;&#39;Forty years after her disappearance, this fascinating collection of her work returns her to us... this writing has unmistakable flair.

But Pankaj Mishra shows that it was otherwise in this stereotype-shattering book. His enthralling group portrait of like minds scattered across a vast continent makes clear that modern Asia's revolt against the West is not the one led by faith-fired terrorists and thwarted peasants but one with deep roots in the work of thinkers who devised a view of life that was neither modern nor antimodern, neither colonialist nor anticolonialist. In broad, deep, dramatic chapters, Mishra tells the stories of these figures, unpacks their philosophies, and reveals their shared goal of a greater Asia. </p><p> Right now, when the emergence of a greater Asia seems possible as at no previous time in history, <i>From the Ruins of Empire </i>is as necessary as it is timely&#x2015;a book essential to our understanding of the world and our place in it.</p></p><p><p><b>Pankaj Mishra</b> was born in India in 1969 and lives in London and Mashobra, India.

A popular general after his victories in northern Italy, he had been lobbying his civilian superiors for an invasion of Britain. But the Royal Navy was still too strong, and the French were not ready to confront it. In the meantime, France needed colonies in order to prosper, as its foreign minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand believed, and a presence in Egypt would not only compensate the French for their loss of territory in North America, it could also pose a serious challenge to the British East India Company, which produced highly profitable cash crops in its Indian possessions. Expanding across India, the British had expelled the French from most of their early bases on the coast. In 1798, the British were locked into a fierce battle with one of their most wily Indian opponents, Tipu Sultan, an ally of France. French control of Egypt could tip the balance of power against the British in India while also deterring the Russians, who eyed the Ottoman Empire. 'As soon as I have made England tremble for the safety of India,' Napoleon declared, 'I shall return to Paris and give the enemy its death blow.' Apart from his country's geopolitical aims, Napoleon cherished his own private fantasy of conquering the Orient. 'Great reputations', he was convinced, 'are only made in the Orient; Europe is too small.'1 From Egypt he planned to push eastwards in an Alexander-the-Great-style invasion of Asia, with him riding an elephant and holding a new, personally revised Koran that would be the harbinger of a new religion. Napoleon travelled to Egypt with a large contingent of scientists, philosophers, artists, musicians, astronomers, architects, surveyors, zoologists, printers and engineers, all meant to record the dawn of the French Enlightenment in the backward East. The momentousness of the occasion - the first major contact between modernizing Europe and Asia - was not lost on Napoleon. On board his ship in the Mediterranean, he exhorted his soldiers: 'You are about to undertake a conquest, the effects of which on civilization and commerce of the world areimmeasurable.'2 He also drafted grand proclamations addressed to the Egyptian people, describing the new French Republic based upon liberty and equality, even as he professed the highest admiration for the Prophet Muhammad and Islam in general. Indeed the French, he claimed, were also Muslims, by virtue of their rejection of the Christian Trinity. He also made some noises - familiar to us after two centuries of imperial wars disguised as humanitarian interventions - about delivering the Egyptians from their despotic masters. Appearing without warning in Alexandria in July 1798, the French overcame all military opposition as they proceeded towards Cairo. Egypt was then nominally part of the Ottoman Empire though it was ruled directly by a caste of former slave-soldiers called Mamluks. Its meagre armies were not equipped to fight war-hardened French soldiers who outnumbered the Egyptians and were also backed by the latest military technology. Reaching Cairo after some easy victories, Napoleon commandeered a mansion for himself on the banks of the then Azbakiya Lake, installed the scholars from his baggage train at a new Institut d'�gypte, and set about politically engineering Egypt along republican lines. He thought up a Divan consisting of wise men, an Egyptian version of the Directory that exercised executive power in Paris. But where were wise men to be found in Cairo, which had been abandoned by its ruling class, the Ottoman Mamluks? Much to their bewilderment, Cairo's leading theologians and religious jurists found themselves promoted to political positions and frequently summoned for consultation by Napoleon - marking the first of many such expedient attempts at politically empowering Islam by supposedly secular Westerners in Asia. Suppressing his allegiance to the Enlightenment, Napoleon vigorously appeased conservative Muslim clerics in the hope they might form the bulwark of pro-French forces in the country. He dressed up in Egyptian robes on the Prophet's birthday and, much to the disquiet of his own secular-minded soldiers, hinted at a mass French conversion to Islam. Some sycophantic (and probably, derisive) Egyptians hailed him as Ali Bonaparte, naming him after the revered son-in-law of the Prophet. This encouraged Napoleon to suggest to the clericsthat the Friday sermon at al-Azhar Mosque, one of Islam's holiest buildings, be said in his name. The devout Muslims were flabbergasted. The head of the Divan, Sheikh al-Sharqawi, recovered sufficiently to say, 'You want to have the protection of the Prophet ... You want the Arab Muslims to march beneath your banners. You want to restore the glory of Arabia ... Become a Muslim!'3 An evasive Napoleon replied: 'There are two difficulties preventing my army and me from becoming Muslims. The first is circumcision and the second is wine. My soldiers have the habit from their infancy, and I will never be able to persuade them to renounce it.'4 Napoleon's attempt to introduce Egyptian Muslims to the glories of French secularism and republicanism were equally doomed. Cairenes deplored his dramatic alterations to the cityscape, and the corrupting influence of the French in general. As one observer wrote, 'Cairo has become a second Paris, women go about shamelessly with the French; intoxicating drinks are publicly sold and things are committed of which the Lord of Heaven would not approve.'5 In the summer of 1798, Napoleon made it mandatory for all Egyptians to wear the tricolour cockade, the knotted ribbon preferred by French republicans. Inviting members of the Divan to his mansion, he tried to drape a tricolour shawl over the shoulders of Sheikh al-Sharqawi. The Sheikh's face turned red from fear of blasphemy and he flung it to the ground. An angry Napoleon insisted that the clerics would have to wear the cockade at least, if not the shawl. An unspoken compromise was finally arrived at: Napoleon would pin the cockade to the chests of the clerics, and they would take it off as soon as they left his company. The Islamic eminences may have been trying to humour their strange European conqueror while trying to live for another day. Many other Muslims saw plainly the subjugation of Egypt by a Christian from the West as a catastrophe; and they were vindicated when French soldiers, while suppressing the first of the Egyptian revolts against their occupation, stormed the al-Azhar mosque, tethered their horses to the prayer niches, trampled the Korans under their boots, drank wine until they were helpless and then urinated on the floor. Napoleon, though ready to burn hostile villages, execute prisoners and tear down mosques for the sake of wide roads, actually indulged in fewer atrocities in Egypt than he was to elsewhere; he was always keen to express his admiration for Islam. Still, the Egyptian cleric and scholar 'Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti, who chronicled Napoleon's conquest of Egypt, described it as 'great battles, terrible events, disastrous facts, calamities, unhappiness, sufferings, persecutions, upsets in the order of things, terror, revolutions, disorders, devastations - in a word, the beginning of a series of great misfortunes'.6 And this was the reaction of a somewhat sympathetic witness. When the news of Napoleon's exploits arrived in the Hejaz, the people of Mecca tore down the drapery - traditionally made in Egypt - around the sacred Kaaba. &nbsp; <br> The dramatic gesture clearly expressed how many Muslims would see Napoleon's invasion of Egypt. It had disrupted nothing less than the long-established cosmic order of Islam - something that human history had shown to be more than a widely shared delusion. The word 'Islam', describing the range of Muslim beliefs and practices across the world, was not used before the nineteenth century. But few Muslims anywhere over the centuries would have doubted that they belonged to both a collective and an individual way of life, an intense solidarity based on certain shared values, beliefs and traditions. To be a good Muslim was to belong to a community of like-minded upholders of the moral and social order. It was also to participate in the making and expansion of the righteous society of believers and, by extension, in the history of Islam as it had unfolded since God first commanded the Prophet Muhammad to live according to His plan. This history began with astonishing successes, and for centuries it seemed that God's design for the world was being empirically fulfilled. In AD 622, the first year of the Islamic calendar, Muhammad and his band of followers established the first community of believers in a small town in Arabia. Less than a century later, Arab Muslims were in Spain. Great empires - Persian and Byzantine - fell before the energetically expanding community of Muslims. Islam quickly became the new symbol of authority from the Pyrenees to the Himalayas, and theorder it created wasn't just political or military. The conquerors of Jerusalem, North Africa and India brought into being a fresh civilization with its own linguistic, legal and administrative standards, its own arts and architecture and orders of beauty. The invading Mongols broke into this self-contained world in the thirteenth century, briskly terminating the classical age of Islam. But within fifty years the Mongols had themselves converted to Islam and become its most vigorous champions. Sufi orders spread across the Islamic world, sparking a renaissance of Islam in non-Arab lands. From Kufa to Kalimantan, the travelling scholar, the trader and the Friday assembly gave Islam an easy new portability. Indeed, Islam was as much a universalizing ideology as Western modernity is now, and it successfully shaped distinctive political systems, economies and cultural attitudes across a wide geographical region: the fourteenth-century Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta had as little trouble getting jobs at imperial courts in India or in West Africa as a Harvard MBA would in Hong Kong and Cape Town today. The notion of a universal community of Muslims, the <i>umma,</i> living under the symbolic authority of a <i>khalifa</i> (caliph), in a <i>Dar al-Islam</i> (land of Muslims), which was distinct from the remote and peripheral <i>Dar al-Harb</i> (land of war), helped Muslims from Morocco to Java to imagine a central place in the world for themselves and their shared values. Itinerant Muslim traders from India were still displacing Hinduism and Buddhism in Indonesia and even Indochina as late as the seventeenth century. Extensive mercantile networks and pilgrimage routes to Mecca from all corners of the world affirmed the unity of <i>Dar al-Islam.</i> World trade in fact depended on Muslim merchants, seafarers and bankers. For a Muslim in North Africa, India or South-east Asia, history retained its moral and spiritual as well as temporal coherence; it could be seen as a gradual working out of God's plan. Though beset by internal problems in the eighteenth century, Muslim empires still regarded Europeans as only slightly less barbarous than their defeated Crusader ancestors. So the success of Napoleon suggested something inconceivable: that the Westerners, though still quite crude, were beginning to forge ahead. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Europe was to express, as the nineteenth century progressed, an idea of itself through its manifold achievements of technology, constitutional government, secular state and modern administration; and this idea, which emerged from the American and French revolutions and which seemed to place the West in the avant-garde of progress, would be increasingly hard to refute. Already in 1798, a remarkably high degree of organization defined the post-revolutionary French state as well as the French people, who were coming together on the basis of an apparently common language, territory and history to constitute a separate and distinct 'nation-state'. Faced with the evidence of Europe's advantages, many Muslims were initially bemused and unable to assess it correctly. 'The newly established republic in France', the Ottoman historian Asim recognized in 1801, 'is different from the other Frankish polities.' But then he went on to say: 'Its ultimate basis is an evil doctrine consisting of the abandonment of religion and the equality of rich and poor.' As for parliamentary deliberations, they were 'like the rumblings and crepitations of a queasy stomach'.7 Some of this cultural arrogance lingered in the eyewitness accounts of Napoleon's conquest by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti. The cleric generally found French practices distasteful, even barbaric: 'It is their custom', he wrote, 'not to bury their dead but to toss them on garbage heaps like the corpses of dogs and beasts, or to throw them into the sea.'8 'Their women do not veil themselves and have no modesty ... They [the French] have intercourse with any woman who pleases them and vice versa.'9 Al-Jabarti also mocked French hats, the European habit of peeing in public, and the use of toilet paper. He contemptuously dismissed Napoleon's claim to be a protector of Islam, laughing at the bad Arabic grammar of the Frenchman's proclamations, and he sniggered when the French failed to launch a hot-air balloon at one of their demonstrations of European scientific prowess. Al-Jabarti's limited experience of political institutions made him misunderstand French revolutionary ideals: 'their term "liberty" means,' he concluded too hastily, 'that they are not slaves like the Mamluks'.10 He sensed the hostility to his own Islamic values in Napoleon's claim that 'all the people are equal in the eyes of God'.'This is a lie, and ignorance, and stupidity,' he thundered. 'How can this be when God has made some superior to others?'11 Still, al-Jabarti, who had been educated at al-Azhar, couldn't fail to be impressed when he visited the Institut d'�gypte, where the intellectuals in Napoleon's entourage had a well-stocked library. Whoever wishes to look up something in a book asks for whatever volumes he wants and the librarian brings them to him ... All the while they are quiet and no one disturbs his neighbor ... among the things I saw there was a large book containing the Biography of the Prophet ... The glorious Qur'an is translated into their language! ... I saw some of them who know chapters of the Qur'an by heart. They have a great interest in the sciences, mainly in mathematics and the knowledge of languages, and make great efforts to learn the Arabic language and the colloquial. 12 Al-Jabarti was also struck by the efficiency and discipline of the French army, and he followed with great curiosity the electoral processes in the Divan that Napoleon had created, explaining to his Arab readers how members wrote their votes on strips of paper, and how majority opinion prevailed. Al-Jabarti was not entirely deaf to the lessons from Napoleon's conquest: that the government in the world's first modern nation-state did not merely collect taxes and tributes and maintain law and order; it could also raise a conscript army, equip ...</p><h2>Pictures Showing What Happens on Each Page of Thomas Pynchon&#39;s Novel Gravity&#39;s Rainbow</h2><p><p><strong>Gravity's Rainbow Illustrated: One Picture for Every Page features the work of an Ivy League-educated, punk-rock, porn-star visual artist who has created a drawing for every page of a novel that is widely considered to be the most difficult work of literature ever produced in English.</strong></p> Thomas Pynchon&#x2019;s Gravity&#x2019;s Rainbow (1973) has been called a modernFinnegans Wake for its challenging language, wild anachronisms, hallucinatory happenings, and fever-dream imagery.

A leading exponent of punk-based, DIY art, Smith here presents his most ambitious project to date -- an art book exactly as long as the work it&#39;s interpreting: 760 drawings, paintings, photos, and less definable images in 760 pages. Extraordinary tableaux of the detritus of war -- a burned-out K�nigstiger tank, a melted machine gun -- coexist alongside such phantasmagoric Pynchon inventions as the &#34;stumbling bird&#34; and &#34;Girgori the octopus.&#34; Smith has stated his aim to be &#34;as literal as possible&#34; in interpreting Gravity&#39;s Rainbow, but his images are as imaginative and powerfully unique as the prose they honor.Zak Smith was born in Syracuse, New York, in 1976. In addition to theGravity&#x2019;s Rainbow illustrations, which were shown in the 2004 Whitney Biennial and are now in the collection of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Smith&#x2019;s recent projects include the multipanel painting 100 Girls and 100 Octopuses and an ongoing series of portraits of friends and acquaintances in the sex industry entitled Girls in the Naked Girl Business as well as a number of stand-alone paintings and drawings, abstract and otherwise. His work has appeared in numerous publications worldwide and is held in many public and private collections, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum. He is a frequent contributor to several independent comics and zines, including Papingand See How Pretty, See How Smart. His first monograph, Zak Smith: Pictures Of Girls, was published in 2005.</p><h2>Semper Fidelis: A Novel of the Roman Empire (The Medicus Series, 5)</h2><p><p>Back at his post as a doctor in the Twentieth legion in Roman-occupied Britain, Ruso uncovers a new danger even closer to home than the neighboring barbarians. </p><p>As mysterious injuries, and even deaths, begin to appear in the medical ledgers, it's clear that all is not well amongst the native recruits to Britannia's imperial army.

When the SEALs send their elite, they send SEAL Team Six</p><p>SEAL Team Six is a secret unit tasked with counterterrorism, hostage rescue, and counterinsurgency. In this dramatic, behind-the-scenes chronicle, Howard Wasdin takes readers deep inside the world of Navy SEALS and Special Forces snipers, beginning with the grueling selection process of Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S)&#x2014;the toughest and longest military training in the world. </p><p>After graduating, Wasdin faced new challenges. First there was combat in Operation Desert Storm as a member of SEAL Team Two. Then the Green Course: the selection process to join the legendary SEAL Team Six, with a curriculum that included practiced land warfare to unarmed combat. More than learning how to pick a lock, they learned how to blow the door off its hinges. Finally as a member of SEAL Team Six he graduated from the most storied and challenging sniper program in the country: The Marine&#x2019;s Scout Sniper School. Eventually, of the 18 snipers in SEAL Team Six, Wasdin became the best&#x2014;which meant one of the best snipers on the planet. </p><p>Less than half a year after sniper school, he was fighting for his life. The mission: capture or kill Somalian warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. From rooftops, helicopters and alleys, Wasdin hunted Aidid and killed his men whenever possible. But everything went quickly to hell when his small band of soldiers found themselves fighting for their lives, cut off from help, and desperately trying to rescue downed comrades during a routine mission. The Battle of Mogadishu, as it become known, left 18 American soldiers dead and 73 wounded. Howard Wasdin had both of his legs nearly blown off while engaging the enemy. His dramatic combat tales combined with inside details of becoming one of the world&#x2019;s deadliest snipers make this one of the most explosive military memoirs in years.</p></p><p><p>DR.

When the SEALs send their elite, they send SEAL Team Six, the navy&#x2019;s equivalent to the army&#x2019;s Delta Force&#x2014;tasked with counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, occasionally working with the CIA. This is the first time a SEAL Team Six sniper&#x2019;s story has been exposed. My story.<br><br>Snipers avoid exposure. Although we prefer to act rather than be acted upon, some forces are beyond our control. We rely on our strengths to exploit the enemy&#x2019;s vulnerabilities; however, during the war in the Persian Gulf I became vulnerable as the lone person on the fantail of an enemy ship filled with a crew working for Saddam Hussein. On yet another occasion, despite being a master of cover and concealment, I lay naked on an aircraft runway in a Third World country with bullet holes in both legs, the right leg nearly blown off by an AK-47 bullet. Sometimes we must face what we try to avoid.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>In the morning darkness of September 18, 1993, in Mogadishu, Somalia, Casanova and I crept over the ledge of a retaining wall and climbed to the top of a six-story tower. Even at this early hour there were already people moving around. Men, women, and children relieved themselves in the streets. I smelled the morning fires being lit, fueled by dried animal dung and whatever else people could find to burn. The fires heated any food the Somalis had managed to obtain. Warlord Aidid knew fully the power of controlling the food supply. Every time I saw a starving child, I blamed Aidid for his evil power play that facilitated this devastation of life.<br><br>The tower we were on was located in the middle of the Pakistani compound. The Pakistanis were professional and treated us with great respect. When it was teatime, the boy in charge of serving always brought us a cup. I had even developed a taste for the fresh goat milk they used in the tea. The sounds and scents of the goatherd in the compound reached my senses as Casanova and I crawled onto the outer lip at the top of the tower. There we lay prone, watching a large garage, a vehicle body shop that had no roof. Surrounding the garage was a city of despair. Somalis trudged along with their heads and shoulders lowered. Helplessness dimmed their faces, and starvation pulled the skin tight across their bones. Because this was a &#x201c;better&#x201d; part of town, multilevel buildings stood in fairly good repair. There were concrete block houses instead of the tin and wooden lean-to sheds that dominated most of the city and countryside. Nevertheless, the smell of human waste and death&#x2014;mixed with hopelessness&#x2014;filled the air. Yes, hopelessness has a smell. People use the term &#x201c;developing countries,&#x201d; but that is bullcrap. What developed in Somalia was things such as hunger and fighting. I think &#x201c;developing countries&#x201d; is just a term used to make the people who coined it feel better. No matter what you call them, starvation and war are two of the worst events imaginable.<br><br>I calculated the exact distances to certain buildings. There are two primary considerations when making a sniper shot, windage and elevation. Because there was no significant wind that could throw my shot left or right, I didn&#x2019;t have to compensate for it. Elevation is the variable considered for range/distance to the target. Since most of my potential targets were between 200 yards (garage) and 650 yards (intersection beyond the target garage), I dialed my scope in at 500 yards. This way I could just hold my rifle higher or lower depending on range. When the shooting began, there would be no time to dial in range corrections on my scope between shots.<br><br>We started our surveillance at 0600. While we waited for our agent to give us the signal, I played different scenarios over in my mind: one enemy popping out at one location, then another popping up at another location, and so on. I would acquire, aim, and even do a simulated trigger pull, going through my rehearsed breathing and follow-through routine while picturing the actual engagement. Then I simulated reloading and getting back into my Leupold 10-power scope, continuing to scan for more booger-eaters. I had done this dry firing and actual firing thousands of times&#x2014;wet, dry, muddy, snowbound, from a dug-in hole in the ground, from an urban sniper hide through a partially open window, and nearly every which way imaginable. The words they had drilled into our heads since we began SEAL training were true, &#x201c;The more you sweat in peacetime, the less you bleed in war.&#x201d; This particular day, I was charged with making sure none of my Delta Force buddies sprang a leak as I covered their insertion into the garage. My buddies&#x2019; not bleeding in war was every bit as important as my not bleeding.<br><br>Our target for this mission was Osman Ali Atto&#x2014;Warlord Aidid&#x2019;s main financier. Although Casanova and I would&#x2019;ve been able to recognize the target from our previous surveillance, we were required to have confirmation of his identity from the CIA asset before we gave the launch command.<br><br>The irony wasn&#x2019;t lost on me that we were capturing Atto instead of killing him&#x2014;despite the fact that he and his boss had killed hundreds of thousands of Somalis. I felt that if we could kill Atto and Aidid, we could stop the fighting, get the food to the people quickly, and go home in one piece.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t until around 0815 that our asset finally gave the predetermined signal. He was doing this because the CIA paid him well. I had learned firsthand while working with the CIA how payoffs could sway loyalty.<br><br>When we saw the signal, Casanova and I launched the &#x201c;full package.&#x201d; Little Bird and Black Hawk helicopters filled the sky. During this time, the Delta operators literally had their butts hanging out&#x2014;the urban environment provided too much cover, too much concealment, and too many escape routes for the enemy. All a hostile had to do was shoot a few rounds at a helo or Humvee, jump back inside a building, and put his weapon down. Even if he reappeared, he was not considered hostile without a weapon. Things happened fast, and the environment was unforgiving.<br><br>Delta Force operators fast-roped down inside the garage, Rangers fast-roped around the garage, and <br>Birds flew overhead with Delta snipers giving the assault force protection. Atto&#x2019;s people scattered like rats. Soon, enemy militia appeared in the neighborhood shooting up at the helicopters.<br><br>Normally, snipers operate in a spotter-sniper relationship. The spotter identifies, ranges the targets, and relays them to the sniper for execution. There would be no time for that on this op&#x2014;we were engaged in urban warfare. In this environment, an enemy could appear from anywhere. Even worse, the enemy dressed the same as a civilian. We had to wait and see his intention. Even if he appeared with a gun, there was a chance he was part of a clan on our side. We had to wait until the person pointed the weapon in the direction of our guys. Then we would ensure the enemy ceased to exist. <br><br>There would be no time for makeup or second shots. Both Casanova and I wielded .300 Win Mag sniper rifles.<br><br>Through my Leupold 10-power scope, I saw a militiaman 500 yards away firing through an open window at the helos. I made a mental note to keep my heart rate down and centered the crosshairs on him as my muscle memory took over&#x2014;stock firmly into the shoulder, cheek positioned behind the scope, eye focused on the center of the crosshairs rather than the enemy, and steady trigger squeezing (even though it was only a light, 2-pound pull). I felt the gratifying recoil of my rifle. The round hit him in the side of the chest, entering his left and exiting his right. He convulsed and buckled, falling backward into the building&#x2014;permanently. I quickly got back into my scope and scanned.&nbsp;<i>Game on now. </i>All other thoughts departed my mind. I was at one with my Win Mag, scanning my sector. Casanova scanned his sector, too.<br>Another militiaman carrying an AK-47 came out a fire escape door on the side of a building 300 yards away from me and aimed his rifle at the Delta operators assaulting the garage. From his position, I&#x2019;m sure he thought he was safe from the assaulters, and he probably was. He was not safe from me&#x2014;300 yards wasn&#x2019;t even a challenge. I shot him through his left side, and the round exited his right. He slumped down onto the fire escape landing, never knowing what hit him. His AK-47 lay silent next to him. Someone tried to reach out and retrieve the weapon&#x2014;one round from my Win Mag put a stop to that. Each time I made a shot, I immediately forgot about that target and scanned for another.<br>Chaos erupted inside and outside of the garage. People ran everywhere. Little Birds and Black Hawks filled the skies with deafening rotor blasts. I was in my own little world, though. Nothing existed outside my scope and my mission. Let the Unit guys handle their business in the garage. My business was reaching out and touching the enemy.<br><br>This wasn&#x2019;t the first time I&#x2019;d killed for my country. It wouldn&#x2019;t be the last.<br><br>A few minutes passed as I continued scanning. More than 800 yards away, a guy popped up with an RPG launcher on his shoulder, preparing to fire at the helicopters. If I took him out, it would be the longest killing shot of my career. If I failed&nbsp;...<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2011 by Howard E.

Montgomery: Vol. 2</h2><p>An instant best-seller in Canada, the first volume of <em>The Selected Journals of L.M. Montgomery</em> recorded the growing power and imagination of one of the world's best-loved writers, the author of the classic novel for children, <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>. The <em>London Free Press</em> hailed it as "pure gold, the deeply felt, finely evocative rendering of years both heartbreakingly sad and splendidly triumphant," and <em>The Montreal Gazette</em> termed it "one of the most haunting documents in Canadian literary history." <br> The second volume promises to be equally intriguing and powerful. Ranging from 1910 to 1921, Montgomery's revealing journal documents a time of great upheaval, both in her life and in the world around her. Here she records her thoughts about the death of her rigid, intolerant grandmother, who had ruled her life so strickly...her troubled marriage to the Reverend Ewan Macdonald...the move from her beloved Prince Edward Island to a small Ontario town...her shocked reaction to the First World War...and the rewards and difficulties of being a noted writer. <br> Spontaneous and frank, these journals are unusual for their narrative interest: Montgomery's gifts as a storyteller are as much in evidence here as in her novels. The autobiographical content will intrigue every dedicated fan of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> and the other Anne books, but the Montgomery journals are also interesting because they provide a unique social history and the privilege of viewing closely the life of a remarkable woman.</p><p><br><em>About the Editors</em>: <br><strong>Mary Rubio</strong> and <strong>Elizabeth Waterston</strong> are both members of the Department of English, University of Guelph.<br>"...a fascinating compendium for those readers interested in social and cultural history, women's studies and Canadian writing -- as well as, of course, the countless 'Anne' aficionados around the globe."

Extremely deserving in her own right, and long overdue for international recognition like this, she is also the first woman to be so honored since the AIA began bestowing this medal in 1907. &nbsp;Morgan joins such architectural luminaries as I.M. Pei, Frank Lloyd Wright, Thomas Jefferson (posthumously), and Frank Gehry as recipients of the AIA Gold Medal.Grade 7-9-- Because Morgan preferred to let her work speak for her, the first substantial biography of her ( Julia Morgan, Architect Abbeville Pr, 1988 by Sara Holmes Boutelle) wasn't written until 30 years after her death. Thus, it may be somewhat remarkable--and unfortunate--that two biographies for young readers so similar in content have been published in the same year. Either would be valuable but few libraries will need both. Wadsworth capably traces Morgan's unprecedented accomplishments, emphasizing her professional life a bit more than Cary James does in Julia Morgan (Chelsea House, 1990). There is some duplication of the black-and-white illustrations, but in Wadsworth's book, the photographs are cropped more closely and the reproduction is better. Several full-color photographs, which more adequately reflect the splendor of William Randolph Hearst's San Simeon, are also included. Those interested in further reading will find a mixed assortment of adult and juvenile books, including Boutelle's extensive study and several general books on architecture. A list of selected buildings designed by Morgan, many of which still stand, is appended. --Jeanette Larson, Mesquite Public Library, TX<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Life of Mary</h2><p>Engage your heart and senses with this colorfully illustrated meditation on the role of Mary, the Mother of Jesus in the life of her son and the Church.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>In the cool air of early spring, on the second Solayi in Maris, the man who wore the uniform of a Telaryn commander stood at the foot of the long stone pier that dominated the south end of the harbor at Kephria. Behind Quaeryt were only ashes and ruins, except for the old stone fort to the immediate south of the pier, and the rising trooper compound more than a mille to the north, situated at the corner of the old fortifications that had once marked the border between Antiago and Bovaria. He looked out onto the Gulf of Khellor, where patches of mist drifted above the dark surface. <br>Then his eyes dropped to the pier, once the pride of the port city that had been leveled by the late Autarch&#x2019;s cannon and imagers. Most of the stone pillars that supported the pier remained solid&#x2014;but not all. The stone-paved surface of the long pier was pitted, and many of the gray paving stones were cracked. A few were shattered. Almost every stone showed signs of fire, either in the ashes in the mortared joins between the stones, or in blackened sections of stone. The wooden bollards were all charred&#x2014;those that remained. One section of the pier, some two hundred yards out from the shore, sagged almost half a yard over a twenty-yard stretch. <br>The <i>Zephyr</i>&#x2014;the large three-masted schooner that had brought Quaeryt, his imagers, and first company to Kephria&#x2014;lay anchored a good half mille out from the pier in the now-quiet waters of the Gulf of Kephria. <br>Quaeryt took a slow deep breath, then concentrated on the section of the pier where it joined the harbor boulevard to the first charred bollards, roughly fifty yards away. <br>The briefest flash of light flared across the first section of the pier, and then the gray stone was shrouded in a white and cold fog that drifted seaward with the slightest hint of a land breeze. When the afterimage of the flash subsided, and the fog had dispersed enough for Quaeryt to see, he smiled. He hadn&#x2019;t even felt any strain, and the first fifty yards of the stone pier looked&#x2014;and were&#x2014;as strong and as new as when they had been first constructed, centuries before. <br>He waited a bit for the frost on the gray stone to melt away, then walked carefully to the end of the section he had rebuilt with his imaging. Once there, he concentrated once again, on the next section of the pier. After the second imaging, he did feel a slight twinge across his forehead. Rather than immediately press on, given the length of the pier requiring rebuilding, Quaeryt lifted the water bottle from his jacket pocket, uncorked it, and took a swallow of the watered lager before recorking the bottle and replacing it in his pocket. <br>&#x201c;Take your time. You&#x2019;ve got all day if you need it.&#x201d; He glanced toward the fort where Vaelora was&#x2014;he hoped&#x2014;taking her time in preparing for the day. He tried not to dwell on the events that had caused her to miscarry their daughter&nbsp;&#x2026; but he had seen the darkness behind Vaelora&#x2019;s eyes when she&#x2019;d thought he wasn&#x2019;t looking. <br>Then he walked slowly to the end of the second rebuilt section, trying not to think about how much of the pier remained to be reconstructed, a good four hundred yards more extending out into the waters where the River Laar and the Gulf of Khellor met and mixed. He glanced to the west where he could barely make out through the morning mist the low smudge of land that had once held Ephra, before the Autarch&#x2019;s imagers and cannon had destroyed it. <br>Finally, he concentrated once more, and another section of the pier was renewed. Quaeryt took a slow deep breath. There had been another twinge as he&#x2019;d imaged, but it hadn&#x2019;t felt any worse than the last one. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to keep taking it slow and easy,&#x201d; he murmured as he took another small swallow of watered lager and waited for the mist and frost to clear. <br>Section by section, over the next three glasses, Quaeryt imaged and rebuilt fifty-yard lengths, although his skull ached slightly more with each effort, and he had to rest longer after each section was completed. <br>After he had finished the last section, and he walked to the seaward end of the pier, Quaeryt took a deep breath and massaged his forehead. His head definitely ached, and faint flashes of light flickered before his eyes, a sign that&#x2014;unless he wanted to be laid up and unable to image for days&#x2014;he was close to his limit for imaging. <i>For now&nbsp;&#x2026; for now. But if you don&#x2019;t keep working to build up your strength, it won&#x2019;t be there when you need it.</i> And he had no doubts he would need it on the return trip to Variana, and most likely even more after he reached the capital city of Bovaria, a land totally defeated, yet, almost paradoxically, far from conquered and certainly a land with more problems, the nastiest of which would likely fall to him&#x2014;and Vaelora&#x2014;to resolve. <br>Standing almost at the end of the pier, Quaeryt gestured, then called, image-projecting his voice toward the <i>Zephyr</i> so that Captain Sario could bring the ship back to the pier to tie up. The quick jab across his skull was a definite reminder that he needed to do no more imaging for some time. <br>He hoped he&#x2019;d recover in a few glasses, but&nbsp;&#x2026; he&#x2019;d have to see. Part of the reason he&#x2019;d worked on the pier was to determine what he could do and how fast he would recover after all his injuries in the battle for Liantiago. <br>While he waited for the schooner to raise enough sail for headway into the pier, Quaeryt lifted the water bottle from his jacket pocket, uncorked it, and took another swallow of the watered lager before recorking the bottle and replacing it. <br>Almost half a glass later, the <i>Zephyr</i> came to rest at the most seaward position at the pier, with the crew making the schooner fast to the pier, and then doubling up the lines. <br>Sario looked from his position on the sterncastle to the pier, and then to Quaeryt. &#x201c;Is it solid?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Come onto the pier and see for yourself.&#x201d; <br>After a moment the Antiagon merchant captain walked forward to midships, then made his way down the gangway that two seamen had extended. Sario stamped his boots on the stone. <br>&#x201c;Solid enough, but it was before. It still could be an illusion.&#x201d; His words held the heavy accent of Antiagon Bovarian, almost a separate dialect, and one that Quaeryt still had to strain to understand. <br>Quaeryt almost said that he didn&#x2019;t do illusions, except that he had. &#x201c;Run your fingers over the stone or the bollard there. There wasn&#x2019;t one here before. It had rotted out.&#x201d; <br>The dark-haired captain did so, then walked another few yards toward the foot of the pier and tried again. Finally, he straightened and walked back to Quaeryt, shaking his head. &#x201c;Why do you not do more like this, instead of destroying men and ships?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because there are few indeed of us, and our greatest value to a ruler is what creates and supports his power. Without the support of a ruler, imagers are killed one by one. That is because few have great power. You saw how my undercaptains collapsed after less than a glass of battle. So we support Lord Bhayar because he has supported us and has pledged to continue to do so. That is the only way in which imagers and their wives and children will ever survive in Lydar&nbsp;&#x2026; or anywhere on Terahnar.&#x201d; The reality was far more complex than that, but Quaeryt wasn&#x2019;t about to go into a long explanation. Instead, he smiled and gestured at the reconstructed pier. &#x201c;So Kephria has a good pier for ships like the <i>Zephyr.</i> Your family might do well to open a small factorage here before others come to understand that Kephria will now serve as the port for both southern Bovaria and northern Antiago.&#x201d; <br>Sario laughed. &#x201c;Commander, you have a way of making your point.&#x201d; His face sobered. &#x201c;Yet&nbsp;&#x2026; I can see the possible truth in what you say. I will talk it over with the others when I return to Westisle.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to make a stop in Liantiago to drop off several of my troopers with dispatches.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can do that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d appreciate it.&#x201d; Quaeryt nodded. &#x201c;You should be able to leave by the end of the week. I&#x2019;ve put out word to the towns inland that you have some space for cargo.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That would be welcome.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We do what we can, Captain.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s your lady, sir?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s much better. Much better, but she needs a few more days before she&#x2019;ll be up to a long ride.&#x201d; <br>Sario offered a sympathetic smile. <br>Quaeryt wished he could offer comfort in return, knowing that the captain had lost his beloved wife some years earlier, and still missed her greatly. <i>You were fortunate that you didn&#x2019;t lose Vaelora to the mistakes you made.</i> But they had lost more than either had intended. &#x201c;Until later, Captain.&#x201d; <br>Sario nodded as Quaeryt turned and walked back toward the foot of the pier&nbsp;&#x2026; and the fort. His head still throbbed, but the pain had been far worse many times before&#x2014;and he had redone the pier without tariffing the other imagers, who had more than enough to do in dealing with rebuilding the trooper compound from the ruins. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by L.

When they met, they embarked upon a naval engagement that escalated into the most spectacular aircraft carrier battle in history. Here is the true account of the battle, told from both sides-by those who were there. Drawing upon numerous interviews as well as official sources, Clash of the Carriers is an unforgettable testimonial to the bravery of those who fought and those who died in a battle that will never be forgotten.</p><p>Barrett Tillman has been an aviation historian for the past 30 years, having written over 500 articles in leading military journals, as well as four novels, a novella, a screenplay, and 30 works of nonfiction. He has received numerous awards for his work, and is an honorary member of three navy squadrons and the American Fighter Aces Association.&#x201c;In this superb work, the greatest naval air battle of all time finally receives the meticulous and comprehensive treatment it deserves. Whether you seek the view from the canopy or the sharp-eyed critique, Barrett Tillman, with unmatched command of the subject, delivers both in spades&#x2014;and for both sides. His heroes are the aviators whatever the uniform they wore, and he illuminates more warts on the U.S. side and the rare gems for the Japanese previously ignored or obscured.&#x201d;&#x2014;Richard Frank, author of <i>Guadalcanal</i> and <i>Downfall</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I saw the war from the deck of a battleship so I cannot render an aviator&#x2019;s view. But I can certainly recommend Barrett Tillman&#x2019;s definitive work on the subject. It does not replace the efforts of Admiral Morison, but amplifies them in a manner both instructive and entertaining.&#x201d;&#x2014;Lt. Col. Jeff Cooper, USMCR, USS <i>Pennsylvania</i>, 1944<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;With the analytical ability of a successful cold-case detective, and the flair of a gifted story teller, Tillman reconstructs the famous battle as seen through the eyes of combatants, both American and Japanese.

Her first Inspector Barnaby novel, &#34;The Killings at Badger&#39;s Drift&#34;, was selected as one of the Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time by the Crime Writers&#39; Association.Critics place Caroline Graham among writers of classic mysteries like Agatha Christie. But this story is so dense with rich characterizations as to seem a new genre. Graham nests her murder plots in gentle social satire; this one pokes affectionate fun at the fringes of mysticism and New Age cults. But her characters are not stereotypes; each flawed and foolish one finds a different way to tug at the reader&#39;s heartstrings. Hugh Ross&#39;s performance adds luster to an already sparkling book. His narration sounds delightfully spontaneous, and his mildly exaggerated vocal characterizations (including a bravura turn as the Valkyric cello-playing priestess) perfectly match the author&#39;s style.

But upon arriving at the reflective age of fifty, I found myself drawn, for the first time, to write long passages that were as stimulating and intriguing to me as any songwriting I had ever done.<br><br>And so <b>Broken Music </b>began to take shape. It is a book about the early part of my life, from childhood through adolescence, right up to the eve of my success with the Police. It is a story very few people know.<br><br>I had no interest in writing a traditional autobiographical recitation of everything that&#x2019;s ever happened to me. Instead I found myself drawn to exploring specific moments, certain people and relationships, and particular events which still resonate powerfully for me as I try to understand the child I was, and the man I became.</p><p>Sting is an award-winning singer, songwriter and human rights activist.Music has always been my refuge from sadness. The guitar I inherited from my uncle John now has decent strings, and I&#x2019;m no longer making the &#x201c;broken&#x201d; music that so upset my grandmother; in fact I&#x2019;m making a lot of progress, but the limitations of my first instrument are holding me back. There are things that I simply can&#x2019;t do with this primitive heirloom.<br><br>From the money I earned on the milk rounds I have saved up enough for a new acoustic guitar that I&#x2019;ve had my eye on. It has been hanging from the wall in Braidford&#x2019;s Music Shop for three months now. I go and see it after school every evening, praying that no one has bought it. It is a beautiful steel&#x2014;stringed instrument with a blond finish, an ebony fingerboard, and delicate marquetry inlaid around the sound hole. It costs me sixteen guineas, which is a large amount of money, but I&#x2019;m in love for the very first time.<br><br>I first heard the Beatles in my final year at junior school. I remember being in the changing rooms of the swimming baths. Mr. Law had just supervised one of our chaotic and impossibly noisy trips to the baths&#x2014;by &#x201c;supervised&#x201d; I mean that no one had actually been drowned. We were drying ourselves off and, as was our custom, flicking towels at each other&#x2019;s genitals. It was at this point that we heard the first bars of &#x201c;Love Me Do&#x201d; from a transistor radio in the corner. The effect was immediate. There was something in the sparseness of the sound that immediately put a stop to the horseplay. John&#x2019;s lonely harmonica and Paul&#x2019;s bass played &#x201c;two to the bar,&#x201d; and then the vocal harmony moved in modal fifths up to minor thirds and back again to a solo voice on the refrain. Not that I could articulate any of this at the time, but I recognized something significant, even revolutionary, in the spare economy of the sound, and the interesting thing is, so did everyone else.<br><br>By the time &#x201c;She Loves You&#x201d; reached number one in the charts I was already at the grammar school, but it wasn&#x2019;t the confident primitivism of the &#x201c;yeah yeah yeah&#x201d; chorus that excited me so much as the G major chord with an added sixth that colored it at the end of the coda. Again, I couldn&#x2019;t articulate this then, but I knew as the G major chord with an added sixth that colored it at the end of the coda. An old dance band clich�, but when the Beatles used it there seemed to be a subtle irony at work. Again, I couldn&#x2019;t articulate this then, but I knew instinctively that it was pointing to a level of sophistication that I hadn&#x2019;t been aware of in pop music until then. The Beatles would succeed in manipulating as many musical forms into their songs, whether classical, folk, rock and roll, the blues, Indian raga, or vaudeville, in a dizzying and seamless pastiche of ideas and cultural references. It was music without frontiers and the ubiquitous soundtrack for a generation that thought it could change the world.<br><br>Jim Berryman, in his otherwise excellent biography, <i>A Sting in the Tale</i>, claims that I was outside the City Hall when the Fab Four played there in 1963, and that I managed to grab a lock of McCartney&#x2019;s hair. This is of course fantasy, and would have been out of keeping with the budding intellectual pretensions that I was nurturing at the time. But it is impossible to stress too much the influence that the Beatles had on my early life, and the fact that they came from a similar background to my own was fundamental to the vague plans of escape and glory that I was hatching in my imagination. Lennon and McCartney were both grammar school boys from humble roots in Liverpool, a town not dissimilar from Newcastle. From their initial chart successes they went on to conquer the world with songs that they wrote themselves. This gave an entire generation of musicians the confidence and permission to at least attempt the same feat.<br><br>I pore over Beatles albums with the same obsessive and forensic scrutiny that I&#x2019;d applied to Rodgers and Hammerstein, only now I have a guitar. I have an instrument that can reproduce the practical magic of the chord structures and the network of riffs that their songs are built on. And what songs, one after the other, album after album. I learn to play them all, confident that if I persevere, what I can&#x2019;t play immediately will yield its secret eventually. I will reapply the needle of the record player again and again to the bars of music that seem beyond my analysis, like a safecracker picking a lock, until the prize is mine. No school subject ever occupies as much of my time or energy. I&#x2019;m not claiming that any kind of prescience about the future is at work here, but there is something in the driven and compulsive nature of this obsession that is unusual, something in the unconscious saying, This is how you escape. This is how you escape.<br><br>It is 1966 and England, having won the World Cup against Germany that summer, is at last enjoying the fruits of the postwar boom and is considered to be, in the quaint argot of the time, &#x201c;swinging.&#x201d; In Newcastle, however, the hedonism of social change and cultural revolution is limited to a small enclave surrounding the university. King&#x2019;s College gives the pubs and clubs and bookshops an air of musty intellectualism and bohemian sophistication. Wittgenstein, of all people, is supposed to have spent some time in the city during the war&#x2014;I can just see him trying to explain the more difficult passages of Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus to the coves in the Haymarket snug in a blue haze of Woodbines and brown ale.<br><br>The Club A Go-Go is above some shops in Percy Street, behind the Haymarket. It was originally a jazz club catering to the sophisticated tastes that developed in and around the university. The Go-Go is where the Animals had their residency before they hit the big time, and living proof that the Beatles miracle could be repeated, even in Newcastle. When I am fifteen years old, the first live band I ever see is there: the Graham Bond Organisation. It is a fortunate introduction. Graham Bond is a big round-faced man with long greasy hair and a mandarin mustache. He plays Hammond organ and alto sax and sings in a gruff and passionate baritone. His band contains figures who will soon become legends: Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, who will become more famous as members of Cream, on bass and drums respectively, and Dick Heckstall-Smith on tenor. The music is harsh and uncompromising and I&#x2019;m not sure if I like it, but I have a strong sense that what is being played has a weight and a seriousness that will later be characterized and then caricatured as &#x201c;heavy.&#x201d; Graham Bond would later become obsessed with the occult and end his own life under a train in London&#x2019;s Underground.<br><br>I go to see John Mayall&#x2019;s Bluesbreakers, again at the Go-Go, although I don&#x2019;t remember which of their subsequently legendary guitarists was on duty that night. It certainly wasn&#x2019;t Clapton, though it may have been Peter Green. But it wasn&#x2019;t until December of that year that I really had my mind blown.<br><br>I would watch Top of the Pops with a religious devotion at 7:30 every Thursday evening. I loved this show with a passion. Almost forty years later I can still see a picture of the DJ, Jimmy Savile, standing in front of a large chart of the top twenty, circa 1966, and am able to sing a line from every entry. Such familiarity with the music of the time could not, however, have prepared me for the whirlwind, the tidal wave, the earthquake, the force of nature that was Jimi Hendrix.<br><br>The Jimi Hendrix Experience appeared on Top of the Pops in December of 1966 and changed everything. Hendrix had transformed &#x201c;Hey Joe,&#x201d; an old folk song, and propelled it by the elegant ferocity of his guitar playing into a sassy, bluesy vehicle of awesome power. His vocal was as sulky and offhand as it was passionate and openly sexual, and as the three-piece band stormed through the three-minute song, I imagined everyone in whole country in front of their tellys sitting bolt upright in their chairs.<br><br>Wow! What the fuck was that?<br><br>It seemed only days later that he would be booked to appear at the Go-Go. The excitement in the town is palpable. I am technically too young to gain admission to a nightclub, but because of my height I can easily pass for eighteen. I have brought a change of clothes in my schoolbag, a pair of Levi&#x2019;s and a white Ben Sherman shirt with a button-down collar. These are the &#x201c;coolest&#x201d; clothes I have, and look fine under my school overcoat. I change out of my uniform in the toilets at the Central Station, trying not to breathe. The lavatory is foul with the pungent stench of urine and sadness. I dress with mesmeric slowness, not wanting to drop any of my clothes on the filthy floor, beneath a faded Ministry of Health poster warning of the dangers of VD. Some hope! I still haven&#x2019;t come close to having sex. There are no girls at school, and most of my evenings are taken up traveling home on trains and buses. When I do get home, I usually have a punitive amount of work to do, and when on those rare opportunities I do meet girls I am painfully shy and haven&#x2019;t a clue what to say. But the other reason is music; I already have my passion. I stow my bag in the lockers at the station and set off at a brisk pace for Percy Street, breathing in the crisp air of the evening in grateful gulps and anticipating something extraordinary.<br><br>There is a long queue stretching around the corner. I tuck myself into the end of the line and wait. I imagine I&#x2019;m one of the youngest people there, although my height allows me some anonymity in the crowd. They are mainly boys, dressed much the same as me, although a few dandified &#x201c;exotics&#x201d; have managed to purchase Afghan coats and are sporting droopy Zapata mustaches and spiffy desert boots.

Finding himself near the ceiling of his bedroom, Daniel Turpin, an author and psychiatrist, briefly looks down on the waxy, gray body of a 73-year-old man before he gets whirled into a vortex and embraced by the light. Peck describes in a first-person narrative how Daniel next finds himself lying down (without a body) in a simple but strangely comforting small green room where he is visited by Sam and Norma, who, he feels, resemble Mormon missionaries but turn out to be his official ``Greeters,'' charged with introducing him to his new life. In subsequent chapters, Daniel meets his wife and his son Tim, now an advanced spirit who, however, never quite answers Daniel's excited questions. There's even a sex scene on a hillside overlooking Assisi, where Daniel is all but seduced by the erotic charms of a spirit named Susan, who turns out to be Satan. The shifting of shapes and scenes is rather like the virtual-reality programs of Star Trek, and indeed Daniel learns that the body, like all things visible, is really a collection of psychic projections from which souls can learn to free themselves. Thus an obese woman, Trish, is literally caught in her own self-image (learning to let go of it is her Purgatory), whereas Hell is a giant financial agency whose employees can never bear to leave. Peck makes clever use of popular near-death motifs and Tibetan Bardostyle confrontations. He admits his debt to C.S. Lewis but avoids the latter's brand of Christianity. Unsettlingly, Daniel (who, after all, seems remarkably like Peck's alter ego) frequently reminds the reader what a great visionary and therapist he was on earth. Useful psychological insights in a loose New Age framework. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>True to its title, Peck's second novel for adults (after A Bed by the Window) imagines an afterlife which, through a number of set pieces, dramatizes some of the earthly concerns of his other books, including the perpetual bestseller, The Road Less Traveled. Daniel, a psychiatrist and successful author much like Peck himself, awakens in a small green room to discover that he has survived his physical death. Hovering about, disembodied but alert, he meets a pair of "greeters" who inform him that heaven, hell and purgatory?Judeo-Christian ideas pervade the narrative?are governed by a "Principle of Freedom." Each soul projects what it wishes to experience?though sometimes, as with Daniel's green refuge, projections are created by committees in order to ease the "Adjustment" from life to the formlessness of heaven. Peck's hell is a garbage can in which about 140,000 souls hide under rocks, too terrified to accept their freedom to choose a greater reality. In time, Daniel learns that purgatory has to do with clinging to mental and emotional attachments; to help the souls there, the most attentive and loving psychotherapy imaginable is provided. Several further encounters?with his deceased wife, a son, a seductive woman?help Daniel let go of his own attachments until he is ready to join a committee. Though talky and lacking dramatic momentum, this story, more a consoling philosophical vision than a full-bodied novel, should appeal to Peck's readership.

Following his highly praised The Structures of Everyday Life and The Wheels of Commerce (winner of the 1983 Los Angeles Times Book Award for History), Braudel now charts the growth of the world economy from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century. Most of the usual matter of history - politics, wars, dynastic rivalries, conflict of religious beliefs and secular ideologies - is left out. What is rendered here with the eye and brush of a master is the human activity that underlies the business of life: the bustle of the market, the calm of the great manipulators of capital, the labor of the slave, the peasant and the factory worker of the early industrial age; the fashions of the rich, the rise of the great cities and financial centers - Genoa, Venice, Amsterdam, London - and the character and development of the trade routes that nourish them; the movements of population, the ebb and flow of wealth, the slide into poverty and decay. The sharply drawn, freshly colored glimpses of individual lives and fortunes that compose this vast moving tapestry reflect the extraordinary vivacity of a historian whose reach of mind is matched by his power to put history under the microscope. The visual impact of his work is not confined to the writing. Maps and graphics are used with characteristic skill to illuminate a point or to demonstrate an argument. The text is profusely illustrated with contemporary prints and drawings from around the world. The translator, Sian Reynolds, who won the Scott-Moncrieff Prize for her rendering of Volume II (The Wheels of Commerce), has once again reproduced in English the speed, vigor, and ease of a great stylist.</p><p></p><h2>Oranges &amp; Sunshine</h2><p><b>Now a major film, the book that exposed the incredible&nbsp;scandal of Britain's forgotten and abused child migrants</b>&nbsp;In 1986 Margaret Humphreys, a British social worker, investigated a woman's claim that at the age of&nbsp;four she had been put on a boat to Australia by the British government. At first thinking it incredulous, Margaret discovered that this was just the tip of an enormous iceberg. Up to 150,000 children, some as young as three years old, had been deported from children's homes in Britain and shipped off to a "new life" in distant parts of the British empire, right up until 1970. Many were told that their parents were dead, and parents often believed that their children had been adopted in Britain. In fact, for many children it was to be a life of horrendous physical and sexual abuse far away from everything they knew. Here, Margaret reveals how she unraveled this shocking secret and how it became her mission to reunite these innocent and unwilling exiles with their families in Britain.

Reprint.</p><p>For many of us, the adventures of Dorothy in Oz will forever be associated not with Judy Garland singing &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; but with W. W.

The Viennese artist Lisbeth Zwerger, however, goes a long way toward providing a new and refreshed set of images for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the humbug wizard. These illustrations are often cockeyed, with occasional realistic details thrown in, like a crow with a corncob in its beak in the first portrait of the Scarecrow.

When play began, the frontiers of their empires lay 2,000 miles apart, across vast deserts and almost impassable mountain ranges; by the end, they were separated by only 20 miles. Karl E. Meyer of <i>The New York Times</i> and Shareen Blair Brysac, documentary filmmaker for CBS, update and significantly expand earlier studies of the imperial rivalry, notably Peter Hopkirk's pioneering <i>The Great Game</i>. <i>Tournament of Shadows</i> reads like a racy adventure story, yet there is no need for the authors to embellish their well-researched facts. The region attracted a host of bizarre characters, each with his own idiosyncratic goals. The authors begin with the journey to Bokhara of an ambitious horse doctor, hired by the East India Company in 1806 to improve its breeding stock, and end with the CIA's assistance to anti-Chinese guerrillas in Tibet during the cold war. American participants in the opening of Central Asia have not previously received much attention, but <i>Tournament of Shadows</i> introduces adventurers such as William Rockhill, commissioned by the Smithsonian Institution in the 1880s to explore Tibet, and William McGovern, who, to the chagrin of the British, reached Lhasa in 1923. The wealth and instability of Central Asia continue to keep the region in the headlines, motivating the Soviet Union's disastrous 10-year intervention in Afghanistan and fueling an international race for resources--especially oil--today. <i>--John Stevenson</i>Karl E.

As Carlson sees it, the dead presidents (and the ways we remember them) tell us a great deal about ourselves, our history, and how we imagine our past and future. For American presidents, there is life after death&#x2015;it&#x2019;s just a little weird.</p><p>In <em>Dead Presidents</em>, Carlson takes readers on an epic trip to presidential gravesites, monuments, and memorials from sea to shining sea. With an engaging mix of history and contemporary reporting, Carlson recounts the surprising origin stories of the Washington Monument, Mount Rushmore, Grant&#x2019;s Tomb, and JFK&#x2019;s Eternal Flame. He explores whether William Henry Harrison really died of a cold, how the assassin&#x2019;s bullet may not have been what killed James A. Garfield, and why Zachary Taylor&#x2019;s remains were exhumed 140 years after he died. And he explains the strange afterlives of the presidents, including why &#x201c;Hooverball&#x201d; is still played in Iowa, why Millard Fillmore&#x2019;s final resting place is next to that of funk legend Rick James, why &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s buried in Grant&#x2019;s Tomb?&#x201d; became a running gag for Groucho Marx, why Ohio and Alaska fought for so long over the name of Mt. McKinley (now known as Denali), and why we exalt dead presidents not just with public statues and iconic paintings but with kitschy wax dummies, Halloween costumes, and bobblehead dolls.</p><p>With an infectious passion for history and an eye for neglected places and offbeat characters reminiscent of Tony Horwitz and Sarah Vowell, Carlson shows that the ways we memorialize our presidents reveal as much about us as it does about the men themselves.</p> 25 illustrations</p><p>Brady Carlson is a reporter and on-air host for Wisconsin Public Radio, formerly with New Hampshire Public Radio.

I looked around, but I could not find it. I looked in books, but I could not find it. I looked within, and found there both the cause and the self-made nature of that cause. I looked again, and deeper, and found the remedy. I found one Law, the Law of Love; one Life, the life of adjustment to that Law; one Truth, the Truth of a conquered mind and a quiet and obedient heart. And I dreamed of writing books which would help men and women, whether rich or poor, learned or unlearned, worldly or unworldly to find within themselves the source of all success, all happiness, accomplishment, all truth. And the dream remained with me, and at last became substantial; and now I send forth these books into the world on a mission of healing and blessedness, knowing that they cannot fail to reach the homes and hearts of those who are waiting and ready to receive them." <p> --James Allen</p><p> from the Foreword</p></p><h2>Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 27, Jeremiah 26-52 (keown/scalise/smothers), 435pp</h2><p><p>The Word Biblical Commentary delivers the best in biblical scholarship, from the leading scholars of our day who share a commitment to Scripture as divine revelation.

Despite the ethnic, linguistic, and political diversity of Caribbean artists, there is a cultural unity in their work that distinguishes it in the larger context of North American and Latin American art. Following a discussion of the pre-Columbian and colonial eras, the author describes how pioneering national art movements in the first half of the twentieth century helped to define an indigenous aesthetic, and how revolution, anti-imperialism, and race-consciousness in the turbulent sixties and seventies affected the face of art. There is a strong relationship between Caribbean popular culture and art, and the book explores the importance of African-Caribbean religions such as Voodoo, Santaria, and Rastfarianism, as well as the influence of Trinidad carnival, the Junkanoo masquerade of the Bahamas, and similar traditions. This wonderfully illustrated survey covers a wide range of artists who have lived and worked in the Caribbean, as well as those who have left the islands but whose background plays a significant role in their work, providing a compelling look at a great body of original and imaginative art.</p><p>In this much-needed in-depth study of the Caribbean's rich art history, Belgium-born, Jamaica-based art historian and teacher Veerle Poupeye presents a thoroughly researched, effective and compact view of interwoven indigenous, African, European and Asian influences that fuel the region's vibrant artistic output. Cultures influencedvariously by the Spanish (Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic), English-speaking societies (Jamaica, the Bahamas, Barbados), African and French cultures (Haiti, Guadeloupe, Martinique),and the the Dutch (Aruba, Bonaire, and Curacao) are all precisely highlighted. In addition to the political and cultural themes of slavery, colonialism, revolution, independence, imperialism, and racial identity, Poupeye's analysis uncovers the strong religious influences of Haitian voodoo, Jamaican Rastafarianism, and Afro-Cuban Santeria, which are found in vibrant paintings like Hector Hyppolite's "The Great Master," Edward Brown's "Ethiopian Apple," and Wilfredo Lam's Picasso-inspired masterpiece "The Jungle." Armed with a detailed glossary of terms and accurate biographical sketches, Poupeye shows the Caribbean as a place where "creolization is an ongoing process and hybridity, plurality, and open-endedness are fundamental characteristics." <i>--Eugene Holley, Jr.</i>Veerle Poupeye is a Jamaica-based art historian, critic, and curator.</p><h2>All the Lives We Ever Lived: Seeking Solace in Virginia Woolf</h2><p><b>A wise, lyrical memoir about the power of literature to help us read our own lives&#x2014;and see clearly the people we love most.</b><br><br><b>&#x201c;Transcendent.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post&nbsp;</i>� &#x201c;You&#x2019;d be hard put to find a more moving appreciation of Woolf&#x2019;s work.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br> Katharine Smyth was a student at Oxford when she first read Virginia Woolf&#x2019;s modernist masterpiece <i>To the Lighthouse</i> in the comfort of an English sitting room, and in the companionable silence she shared with her father.

For years we had spent our weekends sailing, driving between our home in Boston and the Rhode Island marina where we kept the boat, and for years my parents had admired the row of waterfront cottages they could see from the highway bridge. One weekend, leaving me with friends, they stopped at a local real estate agency. &#x201c;The houses on the water almost never come up,&#x201d; the agent said, not quite truthfully, &#x201c;but one came on the market this morning.&#x201d; She took them to see it, a wooden house built in 1890 and in a state of price-deflating disrepair. Sheets of plastic were stapled across its windows; to one side was a garage, to the other a desiccated lawn and concrete steps leading to the water. The small adjoining lot was full of rubble, all that remained of a shack annihilated by a hurricane fifty years before. A night nurse was the house&#x2019;s current occupant, and my parents had to wait until midnight before they were shown inside. They found rooms cramped and badly lit. Dampness seeped from the basement&#x2019;s earth floor. A bare wooden deck faced the water, but it too was wrapped in thick plastic. We&#x2019;ll take it, my parents said, and in the morning signed the papers.<br><br>Both architects, they spent the coming months drawing up plans. They tore down walls and put up new ones; winterized the basement and made it their bedroom. A new deck ousted the living room, and the old deck became the dining room. The garage was transformed into a studio, the empty lot to the south a garden, and every wall that faced the water became a wall of windows. We devoted our weekends that winter to supervising the renovation. A beastly wind leapt off the basin, slipping through cracks and ripping at the plastic sheets that now stood in for windows altogether. The house then was a skeleton; from the water, it looked like an architectural cross section. We wore winter coats indoors. I spent my time collecting the sawdust that drifted like snow into the corners of rooms&#x2014;I liked how light and downy and dry it was&#x2014;and when, come spring, the house was finally finished, I mixed this sawdust with glue, molded it in the shape of a heart, and baked it in the oven.<br><br>That summer my parents planted an olive tree, a dogwood, a Japanese maple, and star magnolias. They put in rose bushes, honeysuckle, and a porcelain vine to soften the deck. They hoped a wisteria plant would gently envelop the trellis over the sunken yard; instead the vine grew freakishly, its weighty boughs promising to fell the structure altogether. My father vowed each summer to rip the wisteria out at its roots, and each summer my mother protested, citing the two glorious May weeks in which it shot forth its cloud of amethyst flowers. There were rolls of sod that steamed in the sunlight&#x2014;my father carried them from the car, set them down on the soil, and gave them a push, unfurling each one like a long green carpet. For a few weeks they showed at the seams, but then the roots plaited together, and I could no longer tell where one piece stopped and the next began. Something similar happened inside, where the rooms at first were neat and spare: one day I looked around me and realized our expanding lives had filled the gaps. We learned quickly how bleached things become in a house on the water, how exhaustively salt and light leach color, leaving behind pale blues and yellows. The spines of books, the cork-tiled floors, the rugs and prints and bed linens&#x2014;each became a cheerfully bloodless version of itself. Before my parents were finished they built a dock and then they put down a mooring of their own. There is a photograph of the three of us posing beside this hunk of chain and metal; it was the last time we would see it before sending it down to the bottom of the sea, to settle in the mud and provide a stay against the tides to come.<br><br>The next summer&#x2014;I must have been about seven&#x2014;my father and I built a doll&#x2019;s house. It was a pretty Victorian home with two bay windows, a wraparound verandah, and scalloped trim along the eaves, and it demanded many months of work; I can still recall the care with which we affixed each individual baluster and shingle, the tackiness of the glue we used to wallpaper the rooms. We painted the woodwork in colors reminiscent of our Boston home: dark green, slate blue, taupe, and russet red. In another photograph from that time, the half-finished doll&#x2019;s house sits at the end of the dining table; through curtainless windows, you can see the lights on the far shore double in the water&#x2019;s surface. My father is consumed by the application of some fixture or other, and I, wearing a flannel, rose-print nightgown, hair matted, am standing on a chair and supervising. I loved playing with that house when it was finally finished; and yet the greatest pleasure of all was in its construction, in the evenings that my father and I passed together in nearly wordless concentration.<br><br>The divide between week and weekend was extreme then, and when I considered the difference, I thought of something he had told me when we were sailing, as our boat, Mistral, was heeling and the wind filling our throats. In Boston our lungs were black and horrible, he said, but in Rhode Island they were lovely and shiny and pink. It was an image I held on to as I went about my days&#x2014;days that I filled with pointed yet purposeless tasks (paddling to nearby sand dunes; watering the rock wall moss), much as a cat will suddenly decide that now is the moment she must leap from the window and dash to the couch.<br><br>The specter of boredom gave rise to ingenuity, I think, which is how I came to clomp down the beach in my roller skates, and make the acquaintance of a horse-shaped boulder I named Star, and build a nest beneath the billiard table, and run barefoot up and down the street; by mid-July, I could stick sewing needles deep into my heels without sensation. I loved beachcombing best, though&#x2014;every day I spent hours wandering the rocky strand at the foot of the seawall, collecting sea glass, broken bits of blue-and-white china, lady&#x2019;s slippers, conch shells, the forsaken skeletons of horseshoe crabs, and, once, a rusty key chain from the Stone Bridge Inn, a hotel a mile down the road that had shuttered twenty-five years earlier. When I&#x2019;d gathered enough shells, my father took me to the hardware store to buy a diamond drill bit&#x2014;the only tool strong enough, he said, to bore into the lady&#x2019;s slippers and make a necklace for my mother. It was years before I noticed the peculiar quality of light the days here possessed, how on afternoons and evenings the house would flood with lemon heat, or how the reflection of the water outside, at once blue and gold and glittering, would throw itself against the ceiling, transforming the rooms into a string of tide pools. But from the very beginning, I felt that light within my lungs.<br><br>&#x201c;if life has a base that it stands upon,&#x201d; Virginia Woolf wrote in &#x201c;A Sketch of the Past,&#x201d; her longest and most abundant memoir, &#x201c;if it is a bowl that one fills and fills and fills&#x2014;then my bowl without a doubt stands upon this memory. It is of lying half asleep, half awake, in bed in the nursery at St Ives. It is of hearing the waves breaking, one, two, one, two, and sending a splash of water over the beach; and then breaking, one, two, one, two, behind a yellow blind. . . . It is of lying and hearing this splash and seeing this light, and feeling, it is almost impossible that I should be here; of feeling the purest ecstasy I can conceive.&#x201d; This brilliant, sea-filled nursery belonged to Talland House, the nineteenth-century home in Cornwall where Virginia, her parents, and her seven siblings spent every summer until she was thirteen. She called this recollection &#x201c;the most important of all my memories,&#x201d; and, much like the schism between my own childhood weeks and weekends, its radiance was in sharp contrast to her impressions of her family&#x2019;s London home, a dim, narrow, six-story townhouse in Kensington where &#x201c;busts shrined in crimson velvet, enriched the gloom of a room naturally dark and thickly shaded,&#x201d; and where, in the words of her sister Vanessa, &#x201c;faces loomed out of the surrounding shade like Rembrandt portraits.&#x201d;<br><br>Talland House&#x2014;its light, its cresting water&#x2014;would be consecrated in Virginia&#x2019;s imagination, saturating not only To the Lighthouse but also Jacob&#x2019;s Room and The Waves. &#x201c;To go sailing in a fishing boat,&#x201d; she waxed in her late fifties, &#x201c;to scrabble over the rocks and see the red and yellow anemones flourishing their antennae; or stuck like blobs of jelly to the rock; to find a small fish flapping in a pool; to pick up cowries; to look over the grammar in the dining room and see the lights changing on the bay. . . . All together made the summer at St Ives the best beginning to life conceivable.&#x201d; The tumbling passage conveys the lasting vigor of these memories; as Hermione Lee notes in her terrific biography of Woolf, Talland House &#x201c;is where she sites, for the whole of her life, the idea of happiness. . . . Happiness is always measured for her against the memory of being a child in that house.&#x201d;<br><br>When Virginia&#x2019;s mother died of rheumatic fever in 1895, the Stephens&#x2019; visits to Talland House abruptly ceased. &#x201c;Father instantly decided that he wished never to see St Ives again,&#x201d; she recalled. &#x201c;And perhaps a month later Gerald [Duckworth, Virginia&#x2019;s half brother] went down alone; settled the sale of our lease to some people called Millie Dow, and St Ives vanished for ever.&#x201d; Some thirty years later, this sudden, devastating break&#x2014;the actual and figurative end to Virginia&#x2019;s childhood&#x2014;would become the inspiration for To the Lighthouse, in which she transposed Cornwall&#x2019;s Talland House, seemingly in its entirety, to the Hebrides, a cluster of islands off the coast of Scotland to which she had never been. (&#x201c;An old creature writes to say that all my fauna and flora of the Hebrides is totally inaccurate,&#x201d; she wrote to Vita, and to Vanessa: &#x201c;there are no rooks, elms, or dahlias in the Hebrides; my sparrows are wrong; so are my carnations.&#x201d;) This house and its story are, quite literally, at the novel&#x2019;s center, as vital to it as the Ramsays and their friends; which is why, during a trip to England to celebrate my grandmother&#x2019;s ninety-ninth birthday, I made a St Ives pilgrimage: I wanted to see what the Cornish landscape might teach me, not just about To the Lighthouse and its author but also about those homes by which we measure happiness.<br><br>It was a clear afternoon in June when I boarded the train in my grandmother&#x2019;s village; sipping wine, passing through Tiverton&#x2014;the namesake of our Rhode Island town&#x2014;I was feeling as dreamy as Virginia about the coming journey. &#x201c;This time tomorrow,&#x201d; she wrote in 1921, &#x201c;we shall be stepping onto the platform at Penzance, sniffing the air, looking for our trap, &amp; then&#x2014;Good God!&#x2014;driving off across the moors to Zennor&#x2014;Why am I so incredibly &amp; incurably romantic about Cornwall?&#x201d; My train pulled in at half past eight, but the sun was still high above the houses, and I thought I could see through the gaps in the buildings the white stripe of Godrevy Lighthouse. Then, suddenly, I turned a bend and St Ives Bay unveiled itself, the same view, more or less, that causes Mrs. Ramsay to stop short, exclaiming aloud at its beauty. &#x201c;For the great plateful of blue water was before her,&#x201d; we first hear of the novel&#x2019;s beacon, &#x201c;the hoary Lighthouse, distant, austere, in the midst; and on the right, as far as the eye could see, fading and falling, in soft low pleats, the green sand dunes with the wild flowing grasses on them.&#x201d; I had read those words a hundred times, and the image they had always conjured was of a seascape much nearer and brighter than this one; for here the lighthouse stood no taller than a matchstick upon its little pile of black rock, and I had to squint to see the thin green lines of land.<br><br>But I liked this readjustment of my vision; in fact it was an enlargement, the gentle pop of a jigsaw puzzle fitting together; and then again when I took a wrong turn after dinner and the cobblestone path curved round and up to reveal a vast sandy beach, with regular waves coiling and crashing in rows of four. The last bit of light shone through between the clouds, and the water beat against the sand&#x2014;I would hear it all night through my bedroom window&#x2014;and I knew then what Virginia meant when she wrote, addressing Cornwall&#x2019;s pull for her, of &#x201c;old waves that have been breaking precisely so these thousand years,&#x201d; and when she wrote, in her original notes for To the Lighthouse, that &#x201c;the sea is to be heard all through it.&#x201d; As much as anywhere I&#x2019;ve ever been, the sea is the lifeblood of St Ives.<br><br>The following morning, I made my way to Talland House. I didn&#x2019;t have a house number, so I relied on Woolf to help me find it. &#x201c;A square house,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;like a child&#x2019;s drawing of a house; remarkable only for its flat roof, and the crisscrossed railing.&#x201d; When, at the end of a cul-de-sac, it finally materialized, I felt a stab of disappointment. Its ivory walls were streaked with rust, and a tangle of exterior metal staircases, providing access to second- and third-floor flats, crept up the rear. A Ford Focus was parked in the driveway. I was still debating my approach when a beefy young man in blue sweatpants walked out with a Rottweiler&#x2014;the epitome of a Virginia Woolf fan, in other words. &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; he asked, suspicious.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just looking at the house,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You know Virginia Woolf lived here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it okay if I look around?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said again, gesturing toward a snarl of vegetation. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lawn round back if you like.&#x201d;<br><br>I thanked him, wondering how many seekers had appeared at his door, then plunged into the upper garden. I knew the grounds were greatly changed; much of the land had been sold off, and a parking lot replaced the orchard. But I could still see what Leslie Stephen had meant by &#x201c;a garden of an acre or two all up and down hill, with quaint little terraces divided by hedges of escallonia.&#x201d;</p><h2>Where Angels Go: Shirley, Goodness &amp; Mercy are Back</h2><p><b>Christmas is a time for angel.</b><br><br>Shirley, Goodness and Mercy are back!

Nash�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s celebrated history of the postwar conservative intellectual movement has become the unquestioned standard in the field. This new edition, published in commemoration of the volume�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s thirtieth anniversary, includes a new preface by Nash and will continue to instruct anyone interested in how today�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s conservative movement was born.</p><p>When this book was first published in 1976, Ronald Reagan was a governor and Newt Gingrich a college professor. Today, it is the single best source of information on the intellectuals who built modern American conservatism. A new epilogue tries to bridge the gap of two decades, but this contemporary classic&#39;s real value lies in its thoughtful account of what happened in the 30 years following World War II. By combining history and political theory, it tells how a diverse group of thinkers that included William F. Buckley, Jr., Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, Irving Kristol, Leo Strauss and others laid the philosophical groundwork for Reagan&#39;s presidency and Gingrich&#39;s speakership.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George H.

They stole a dozen masterpieces, including one Vermeer, three Rembrandts, and five Degas. But after thousands of leads, hundreds of interviews, and a $5-million reward, not a single painting has been recovered. Worth a total of $500 million, the missing masterpieces have become the Holy Grail of the art world and one of the nation's most extraordinary unsolved mysteries.</p><p>Art detective Harold Smith worked on the theft for years, and after his death, reporter Ulrich Boser inherited his case files. Traveling deep into the art underworld, Boser explores Smith's unfinished leads and comes across a remarkable cast of characters, including the brilliant rock 'n' roll art thief; the golden-boy gangster who professes his innocence in rhyming verse; the deadly mobster James "Whitey" Bulger; and the Boston heiress Isabella Stewart Gardner, who stipulated in her will that nothing should ever be changed in her museum, a provision followed so closely that the empty frames of the stolen works still hang on the walls. Boser eventually cracks one of the biggest mysteries of the case and uncovers the identities of the men who robbed the museum nearly two decades ago.

But in a shadowy, crumbling housing development, a junkie lies dead of an overdose, his bruised body surrounded by signs of Satanic worship. John Rebus could call the death and accident--but won't. Instead, he tracks down a violent-tempered young woman who knew the dead boy and heard him cry out his terrifyng last words: "Hide! Hide!" Now, with the help of a bright, conflicted young detective, Rebus is following the girl through a brutal world of bad deals, bad dope and bad company. From a beautiful city's darkest side to the private sanctums of the upper crust, Rebus is seeking the perfect hiding place for a killer.<br></p><p>Ian Rankin is a worldwide #1 bestselling writer and has won an Edgar Award, a Gold Dagger for fiction, a Diamond Dagger for career excellence, and the Chandler-Fulbright Award. He lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, with his wife and their two sons.Hide!&#x2019; <p></p>He was shrieking now, frantic, his face drained of all colour. She was at the top of the stairs, and he stumbled towards her, grabbing her by the arms, propelling her downstairs with unfocussed force, so that she feared they would both fall. She cried out. <p></p>&#x2018;Ronnie! Hide from who?&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Hide!&#x2019; he shrieked again. &#x2018;Hide! They&#x2019;re coming! They&#x2019;re coming!&#x2019; <p></p>He had pushed her all the way to the front door now. She&#x2019;d seen him pretty strung out before, but never this bad. A fix would help him, she knew it would. And she knew, too, that he had the makings upstairs in his bedroom. The sweat trickled from his chilled rat&#x2019;s-tails of hair. Only two minutes ago, the most important decision in her life had been whether or not to dare a trip to the squat&#x2019;s seething lavatory. But now&#x2026;. <p></p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re coming,&#x2019; he repeated, his voice a whisper now. &#x2018;Hide.&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Ronnie,&#x2019; she said, &#x2018;you&#x2019;re scaring me.&#x2019; <p></p>He stared at her, his eyes seeming almost to recognise her. Then he looked away again, into a distance all of his own. The word was a snakelike hiss. <p></p>&#x2018;Hide.&#x2019; And with that he yanked open the door. It was raining outside, and she hesitated. But then fear took her, and she made to cross the threshold. But his hand grabbed at her arm, pulling her back inside. He embraced her, his sweat sea-salty, his body throbbing. His mouth was close to her ear, his breath hot. <p></p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;ve murdered me,&#x2019; he said. Then with sudden ferocity he pushed her again, and this time she was outside, and the door was slamming shut, leaving him alone in the house. Alone with himself. She stood on the garden path, staring at the door, trying to decide whether to knock or not. <p></p>It wouldn&#x2019;t make any difference. She knew that. So instead she started to cry. Her head slipped forward in a rare show of self-pity and she wept for a full minute, before, breathing hard three times, she turned and walked quickly down the garden path (such as it was). Someone would take her in. Someone would comfort her and take away the fear and dry her clothes. <p></p>Someone always did. <p></p>JOHN REBUS stared hard at the dish in front of him, oblivious to the conversation around the table, the background music, the flickering candles. He didn&#x2019;t really care about house prices in Barnton, or the latest delicatessen to be opened in the Grassmarket. He didn&#x2019;t much want to speak to the other guests&#x2014;a female lecturer to his right, a male bookseller to his left&#x2014;about&#x2026; well, what ever they&#x2019;d just been discussing. Yes, it was the perfect dinner party, the conversation as tangy as the starter course, and he was glad Rian had invited him. Of course he was. But the more he stared at the half lobster on his plate, the more an unfocussed despair grew within him. What had he in common with these people? Would they laugh if he told the story of the police alsatian and the severed head? No, they would not. They would smile politely, then bow their heads towards their plates, acknowledging that he was&#x2026; well, <i>different</i> from them. <p></p>&#x2018;Vegetables, John?&#x2019; <p></p>It was Rian&#x2019;s voice, warning him that he was not &#x2018;taking part&#x2019;, was not &#x2018;conversing&#x2019; or even looking interested. He accepted the large oval dish with a smile, but avoided her eyes. <p></p>She was a nice girl. Quite a stunner in an individual sort of way. Bright red hair, cut short and pageboyish. Eyes deep, striking green. Lips thin but promising. Oh yes, he liked her. He wouldn&#x2019;t have accepted her invitation otherwise. He fished about in the dish for a piece of broccoli that wouldn&#x2019;t break into a thousand pieces as he tried to manoeuvre it onto his plate. <p></p>&#x2018;Gorgeous food, Rian,&#x2019; said the bookseller, and Rian smiled, accepting the remark, her face reddening slightly. That was all it took, John. That was all you had to say to make this girl happy. But in his mouth he knew it would come out sounding sarcastic. His tone of voice was not something he could suddenly throw off like a piece of clothing. It was a part of him, nurtured over a course of years. So when the lecturer agreed with the bookseller, all John Rebus did was smile and nod, the smile too fixed, the nod going on a second or two too long, so that they were all looking at him again. The piece of broccoli snapped into two neat halves above his plate and splattered onto the tablecloth. <p></p>&#x2018;Shite!&#x2019; he said, knowing as the word escaped his lips that it was not quite appropriate, not quite the <i>right</i> word for the occasion. Well, what was he, a man or a thesaurus? <p></p>&#x2018;Sorry,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Couldn&#x2019;t be helped,&#x2019; said Rian. My God, her voice was cold. <p></p>It was the perfect end to a perfect weekend. He&#x2019;d gone shopping on Saturday, ostensibly for a suit to wear tonight. But had baulked at the prices, and bought some books instead, one of which was intended as a gift to Rian: <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>. But then he&#x2019;d decided he&#x2019;d like to read it himself first, and so had brought flowers and chocolates instead, forgetting her aversion to lilies ( <i>had he known in the first place?</i>) and the diet she was in the throes of starting. Damn. And to cap it all, he&#x2019;d tried a new church this morning, another Church of Scotland offering, not too far from his flat. The last one he&#x2019;d tried had seemed unbearably cold, promising nothing but sin and repentance, but this latest church had been the oppressive opposite: all love and joy and what was there to forgive anyway? So he&#x2019;d sung the hymns, then buggered off, leaving the minister with a handshake at the door and a promise of future attendance. <p></p>&#x2018;More wine, John?&#x2019; <p></p>This was the bookseller, proffering the bottle he&#x2019;d brought himself. It wasn&#x2019;t a bad little wine, actually, but the bookseller had talked about it with such unremitting pride that Rebus felt obliged to decline. The man frowned, but then was cheered to find this refusal left all the more for himself. He replenished his glass with vigour. <p></p>&#x2018;Cheers,&#x2019; he said. <p></p>The conversation returned to how busy Edinburgh seemed these days. Here was something with which Rebus could agree. This being the end of May, the tourists were almost in season. But there was more to it than that. If anyone had told him five years ago that in 1989 people would be emigrating north from the south of England to the Lothians, he&#x2019;d have laughed out loud. Now it was fact, and a fit topic for the dinner table. <p></p>Later, much later, the couple having departed, Rebus helped Rian with the dishes. <p></p>&#x2018;What was wrong with you?&#x2019; she said, but all he could think about was the minister&#x2019;s handshake, that confident grip which bespoke assurances of an afterlife. <p></p>&#x2018;Nothing,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s leave these till morning.&#x2019; <p></p>Rian stared at the kitchen, counting the used pots, the half-eaten lobster carcasses, the wine glasses smudged with grease. <p></p>&#x2018;Okay,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;What did you have in mind instead?&#x2019; <p></p>He raised his eyebrows slowly, then brought them down low over his eyes. His lips broadened into a smile which had about it a touch of the leer. She became coy. <p></p>&#x2018;Why, Inspector,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Is that supposed to be some kind of a clue?&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Here&#x2019;s another,&#x2019; he said, lunging at her, hugging her to him, his face buried in her neck. She squealed, clenched fists beating against his back. <p></p>&#x2018;Police brutality!&#x2019; she gasped. &#x2018;Help! Police, help!&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Yes, madam?&#x2019; he inquired, carrying her by the waist out of the kitchen, towards where the bedroom and the end of the weekend waited in shadow. <p></p>LATE EVE NING at a building site on the outskirts of Edinburgh. The contract was for the construction of an office development. A fifteen-foot-high fence separated the works from the main road. The road, too, was of recent vintage, built to help ease traffic congestion around the city. Built so that commuters could travel easily from their countryside dwellings to jobs in the city centre. <p></p>There were no cars on the road to night. The only sound came from the slow chug-chugging of a cement mixer on the site. A man was feeding it spadefuls of grey sand and remembering the far distant days when he had laboured on a building site. Hard graft it had been, but honest. <p></p>Two other men stood above a deep pit, staring down into it. &#x2018;Should do it,&#x2019; one said. <p></p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; the other agreed. They began walking back to the car, an ageing purple Mercedes. <p></p>&#x2018;He must have some clout. I mean, to get us the keys to this place, to set all this up. Some clout.&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Ours is not to ask questions, you know that.&#x2019; The man who spoke was the oldest of the three, and the only Calvinist. He opened the car boot. Inside, the body of a frail teenager lay crumpled, obviously dead. His skin was the colour of pencil shading, darkest where the bruises lay. <p></p>&#x2018;What a waste,&#x2019; said the Calvinist. <p></p>&#x2018;Aye,&#x2019; the other agreed. Together they lifted the body from the boot, and carried it gently towards the hole. It dropped softly to the bottom, one leg wedging up against the sticky clay sides, a trouser leg slipping to show a naked ankle. <p></p>&#x2018;All right,&#x2019; the Calvinist said to the cement man. &#x2018;Cover it, and let&#x2019;s get out of here. I&#x2019;m starving.&#x2019; <p></p>Excerpted from Hide And Seek by IAN RANKIN. <p></p>Copyright � 1990 by Ian Rankin. <p></p>Published in 1990 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press <p></p>All rights reserved.

In New Treehouses of the World, world-renowned treehouse designer and builder Pete Nelson takes readers on an exciting, international tour of more than 35 new treehouses that reveal how treehouses are designed, constructed, and appreciated in a wide array of cultures and settings. Both beautifully photographed and thoughtfully written by Pete Nelson, New Treehouses of the World documents Nelson&#39;s travels, discoveries, and epiphanies, and explores the ever-growing new frontier of arboreal architecture. The message that Nelson promotes is simple: As sustainable living issues stand poised to become the most important challenges facing the post-millennial age, the positive power and goodwill that a simple treehouse engenders is of greater importance than ever before.</p><p></p><h2>Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner</h2><p>The 1992 release of the "Director's Cut" only confirmed what the international film cognoscenti have know all along: Ridley Scott's <em>Blade Runner,</em> based on Philip K. Dick's brilliant and troubling SF novel <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,</em> still rules as the most visually dense, thematically challenging, and influential SF film ever made. <p> Future Noir is the story of that triumph. </p><p> The making of Blade Runner was a seven-year odyssey that would test the stamina and the imagination of writers, producers, special effects wizards, and the most innovative art directors and set designers in the industry. </p><p> A fascinating look at the ever-shifting interface between commerce and the art that is modern Hollywood, Future Noir is the intense, intimate, anything-but-glamerous inside account of how the work of SF's most uncompromising author was transformed into a critical sensation, a commercial success, and a cult classic.</p></p><p><p>Paul M. Sammon's distinctive career can best be described by the film industry expression "hyphenate."</p><p>As a writer, Sammon has published numerous articles, short stories and books. His many film journalism pieces have seen print in <em> The American Cinematographer, Cahiers du Cinema, The Los Angeles Times, Omni, Cinefex, </em> and <em> Cinefantastique. </em> Sammon's fiction has appeared in <em> Peter Straub's Ghosts </em> (1995), and he recently edited both the 1994 "dead Elvis" anthology <em> The King Is Dead </em> plus the "no limits" anthologies <em> Splatterpunks: Extreme Horror and Splatterpunks II: Over the Edge </em> (1995).</p><p>But Paul M. Sammon does not only write about movies--he works in them as well. He first entered the industry as a publicist in the late 1970s, before moving on as a second-unit director, special effects coordinator, still photographer, electronic press kit producer, and Vice President of Special Promotions. Some of the scores of motion pictures on which Sammon has labored include <em> RoboCop, Platoon, Blue Velvet, Conan the Barbarian, </em> and <em> The Silence of the Lambs. </em> </p><p>By the late 1980s, Sammon was working in Japanese television, where he coproduced popular entertainment programs like <em> Hello! Movies </em> for the TV Asahi network. By the 1990s, Sammon had served as Computer Graphics Supervisor for <em> RoboCop 2; </em> he recently was Digital and Optical Effects Supervisor for 1995's <em> XTRO: Watch the Skies. </em> </p><p>Despite this background, however, Sammon still likes nothing better than sitting down with a good movie. And <em> Blade Runner </em> remains one of his favorite films.</p></p><h2>The Sign of Four</h2><p><p> Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s second Sherlock Holmes novel is both a detective story and an imperial romance. Ostensibly the story of Mary Morstan, a beautiful young woman enlisting the help of Holmes to find her vanished father and solve the mystery of her receipt of a perfect pearl on the same date each year, it gradually uncovers a tale of treachery and human greed. The action audaciously ranges from penal settlements on the Andaman Islands to the suburban comfort of South London, and from the opium-fuelled violence of Agra Fort during the Indian &#x2018;Mutiny&#x2019; to the cocaine-induced contemplation of Holmes&#x2019; own Baker Street. </p> <p> This Broadview Edition places Doyle&#x2019;s tale in the cultural, political, and social contexts of late nineteenth-century colonialism and imperialism. The appendices provide a wealth of relevant extracts from hard-to-find sources, including official reports, memoirs, newspaper editorials, and anthropological studies. </p></p><p>&#34;Barker adapts character voices adroitly, showing an especially uncanny ear for stuffed-shirt aristocrats.&#34;<p> <strong>Shafquat Towheed</strong> is a Lecturer in English at the Open University, UK. </p></p><h2>To Dream in the City of Sorrow (Babylon 5)</h2><p>Ambassador to the alien world of Minbar, former Babylon 5 commander Jeffrey Sinclair, is one of the first to learn the truth about the Shadows, the ancient race pursuing the destruction of the galaxy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair also discovers a startling secret: he is the linchpin in the plan to stop them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sinclair is asked to revive the legendary Minbari warrior group, the Rangers, but it may cost him his one chance to love...and his life.<br><br>Catherine Sakai, a commercial pilot and planetary surveyor, has lost her heart to Jeffrey Sinclair.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even an attack by the Shadows can stop her from going to Minbar to join him...and the Rangers.&nbsp;&nbsp;As she trains with other pilots, including the mysterious Marcus Cole, the time is coming when their skills will be tested on their first mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;Led by Sinclair, they will venture into deepest space, into a battle of stealth and might, and toward a fate that none but the bravest can face...and none but the luckiest will survive.</p><p>&#x201c;Some of the most intelligent science fiction on television.&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;Newsweek</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is the best television show ever made.&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;TV Guide</i>"Alpha 7 to Alpha Leader, I'm hit!"<br><br>Static swallowed the rest of the frantic words.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as he shouted his reply, Earthforce Lieutenant Jeffrey Sinclair saw Quinton Orozco's Starfury flash past overhead, trailing smoke and flames, shadowed by a Minbari fighter, "Pull out! Pull out!&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpha 7!"<br><br>"He's gone."<br><br>That was Bill Mitchell's voice in the earpiece of his helmet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair checked the scope on his instrument panel, then did a quick visual check through the cockpit windshield and canopy.&nbsp;&nbsp;How many of his squadron were left against the Minbari onslaught?&nbsp;&nbsp;How many Human ships were left at all?<br><br>"Stay in formation," Sinclair ordered as he brought his Starfury around, turning away from the sun to face what seemed to be the greater concentration of Minbari fighters.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold the line.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one gets through, no matter what!"<br><br>"Understood," came Mitchell's voice again, then a burst of static and "Alpha Leader!&nbsp;&nbsp;You've got a Minbari on your tail!"<br><br>But Sinclair had already seen it, and was about to initiate a defensive response within the formation when he saw Mitchell's Starfury break formation to loop up and back, over Sinclair's head and toward his pursuing attacker. Other members of the squadron followed Mitchell's lead.<br><br>"I'm on him."<br><br>"No! Mitchell! Stay in formation! It might be a--"<br><br>Sinclair's instrument panel indicated a massive jump point opening behind him, right out of the blinding glare of the sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh my God.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a trap!"<br><br>It shouldn't have been possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assurances had been made that a widespread pattern of vortex frequency interference would be broadcast continuously, making it impossible for the enemy to open jump points within the Line.&nbsp;&nbsp;But a shadow fell across Sinclair's ship as a massive Minbari cruiser, larger than any he'd seen before, came out of a jump point behind him.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only chance for escape was to outrun it and regroup, but what was left of his squadron had been lured into heading full speed right at the cruiser.<br><br>"Mitchell!&nbsp;&nbsp;Break off!&nbsp;&nbsp;Break off!"<br><br>It was too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Bill Mitchell's ship blown to bits. Devorah Eisenstadt's Starfury cut in two.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jake Owasaka's ship sent tumbling wildly to smash into Alo Makya's Starfury, destroying both.&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a few seconds, every ship of his squadron and all the ships around him were destroyed.<br><br>An energy beam from the Minbari cruiser sliced through the skin of Sinclair's upper starboard engine, spinning his craft out of control.&nbsp;&nbsp;His computer gave him the bad news as he fought to regain control of his ship.<br><br>"Aft stabilizers hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weapons systems at zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;Defensive grid at zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;Power plant near critical mass.&nbsp;&nbsp;Minbari weapons systems locking on."<br><br>Sinclair reestablished control of his Starfury and turned it back toward the looming Minbari warship.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not like this!&nbsp;&nbsp;Not like this!" he shouted, not caring that they didn't hear him.&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I'm going out, I'm taking you bastards with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Target main cruiser.&nbsp;&nbsp;Set for full-velocity ram.&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterburners on my mark...Mark!"<br><br>Sinclair was thrown back in his seat as every last bit of fuel in his craft ignited to send him hurtling on a collision course toward the Minbari cruiser. Ten, nine, eight, seven...<br><br>But something was wrong, even more terribly wrong than it had been just a moment before.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minbari cruiser was changing, undulating like a living creature, morphing before his eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Long tendrils grew outward from the ship, and a powerful energy surge crackled along the tendrils gathering to a sphere of destructive energy at their tips.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly it wasn't a Minbari cruiser at all. It was a Vorlon warship.&nbsp;&nbsp;And there were hundreds more of them, all converging on Babylon 5, intent on destroying his space station.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what was that just beyond the outermost Vorlon ship, moving back and forth between the lights of the distant stars?&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadowy shapes, dark and spindly, difficult to see or even focus on.&nbsp;&nbsp;What was happening?<br><br>Before Sinclair could react, a blinding flash obliterated the scene--<br>Metal fiber ropes bit into Sinclair's wrists and legs, held him motionless, suspending him at the center of a darkened, cavernous room where one bright beam of light shone down on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just beyond the rim of light, he could see shadowy figures, humanoid, robed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The torture he had endured at the hands of those creatures for--what? hours? days?--had been so intense that he was now moving beyond the pain that racked his body.&nbsp;&nbsp;His consciousness seemed to be floating above the scene. One of the hooded figures approached, stood before him, held up a small triangular object that seemed to be wire and metal shaped into a triangle with a stone suspended at the center.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Triluminary. The stone began to glow.<br><br>"Who are you?"&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair managed to force the words out through his pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you doing this?"&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to look at the face under the hood--it was Minbari, clearly, but who?&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment it could have been Neroon, but then it might be Rathenn, or perhaps it was Jenimer, the Chosen One, or--Delenn?<br><br>"We claim your soul," said the voice from under the hooded robes, "as our own."<br><br>"No!" Sinclair shouted.&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled against the binding ropes, felt them bite into his flesh, felt the blood running down his arms and legs.&nbsp;&nbsp;"NO!"<br><br>Sinclair woke up shouting, and with a violent motion wrenched himself upright in the bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drenched in sweat, his heart pounding furiously, he shivered uncontrollably from the intensity of the dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, for a short, disorienting moment, he could not figure out where he was.&nbsp;&nbsp;These were not his quarters on Babylon 5.<br><br>Slowly, he began to calm down and regain his bearings.&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around at the small bedchamber which was dimly illuminated from one corner of the room by a small brazier filled with some type of glowing stones rather than coals.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two doors, both shut, and no windows; the walls were unadorned, and the only furnishings were the hard, narrow bed he was sitting up on, a single low bench on which some clothes were carefully laid out, and a large metal chest, inlaid with a delicate triangular pattern of gems.<br><br>Minbar.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was on the homeworld of the Minbari Federation, former deadly enemies of the Human species, and now their most powerful ally.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in the capital city Yedor.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in his quarters in the exclusive residential area set aside for off-world visitors and residents such as himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was Earth's first ambassador to Minbar.<br><br>Sinclair realized he was now shivering more from the cold temperature in the room than the dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;He swung his legs over the side of the bed and let the feeling of the cold, stone floor against his feet wake him further, also knowing that motion would signal the automatic sensors to turn up the heat.<br><br>He wasn't in the midst of his enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wasn't on Minbar as a prisoner.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had agreed to come here.<br><br>Sinclair wondered what time it was, then laughed at himself a little; he was always wondering what time it was.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minbari day was twenty hours and forty-seven minutes long.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since arriving on Minbar a little under three Earth standard weeks ago, his just-under-twenty-five-hour Human body clock had been precessing through the shorter Minbari days, leaving him with what felt like a permanent case of jet lag.<br><br>With a sigh, he rose and went over to the bench where he had left his watch.

If it were just polite social bowing, common in some cultures, it wouldn't have bothered him so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this too often became the bowing and scraping that he'd only seen in movies when the all-powerful ruler of some exotic, ancient land entered a room.&nbsp;&nbsp;It got to be a little embarrassing at times.<br><br>When he opened the door to the bathroom, the bright light from the early morning sun streaming through the skylights momentarily blinded him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedrooms did not have windows, but the bathroom was open to the sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked the clothes he had washed the previous evening in the rock pool and miniature waterfall, which served as bathtub and shower and which were even now splashing cheerfully in a continuous recycling of water.&nbsp;&nbsp;It always reminded Sinclair of a hotel room in New Vegas, but somehow more spiritual.<br><br>Good, the clothes were dry.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted them folded and put away before his "helpers" arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew his Minbari hosts thought it odd for an ambassador to be washing his own clothes, but he had left Babylon 5 for Earth and then Earth for Minbar so abruptly he had only brought a couple of changes of clothing with him, and now that he had no idea when he might get more sent out to him, he was guarding what he did have car...</p><h2>Stork Naked (Xanth, No. 30)</h2><p><p>Surprise Golem has just lost her brand-new baby.

Her husband and parents were away, scouting for a suitable home for the new family. With her magic talents she could handle the children, but they were trying to set off the peeve. That was mischief.<br>&nbsp;<br>The peeve eyed Ted. &#x201c;Your father can&#x2019;t get out of bed. Want to know why?&#x201d; It spoke in Ted&#x2019;s voice.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ted swelled up indignantly, but the peeve was already eyeing Monica. &#x201c;Your mother slithers on her belly,&#x201d; it said with her voice.<br>&nbsp;<br>Monica opened her mouth angrily.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Because it may tease you back,&#x201d; Surprise said. &#x201c;And nothing teases worse than the peeve.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But the battle was fairly started. &#x201c;I know why he can&#x2019;t get out of bed,&#x201d; Ted said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s because Mom keeps him there, blissed out, so he won&#x2019;t be in the way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And how does she do that, you ignorant juvenile crossbreed?&#x201d; the peeve demanded insolently.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try to answer that!&#x201d; Surprise said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Ted asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Because of the Adult Conspiracy, dummy,&#x201d; Monica informed him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re only ten years old.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well so are you, double dummy!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Children, don&#x2019;t fight,&#x201d; Surprise said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no shame to be ten. I was ten once.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But you outgrew it,&#x201d; Monica said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And so will you, in a few more years.&#x201d; It was tricky keeping a lid on it, because both children knew more of the dread Conspiracy than they admitted, because of their half-demon heritage and suspiciously tolerant parents. Surprise didn&#x2019;t want to get blamed for a violation. She was babysitting them because their parents were busy elsewhere and few others could handle them. The two children were not related, but were like mischievous siblings with special powers. They were indeed ten years old, but often acted half that age, reveling in their childishness.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, I guess so,&#x201d; Ted agreed, grudgingly satisfied.<br>&nbsp;<br>But the peeve wasn&#x2019;t satisfied. &#x201c;That leaves your mother, who can&#x2019;t stand on her own two feet,&#x201d; it said in Monica&#x2019;s voice. That was one of its annoying properties: it borrowed the voice of the one it was with, or whoever it was addressing, so that it seemed to third parties that the victimized person was talking. That could be distinctly awkward at times.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because she&#x2019;s a naga,&#x201d; Monica said. &#x201c;Nagas don&#x2019;t have feet in their natural forms.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The peeve opened its beak, ready to set the children off again. It lived to insult people, and the angrier it made them, the more satisfied it was. It had finally found a home here because Surprise&#x2019;s father was Grundy Golem, the only one who could match the irascible bird insult for insult. The two got along well. But the last thing she wanted was to have the two half-demons getting into a contest with the bird. The Adult Conspiracy was bound to get tweaked if not outright abused.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s tell a story,&#x201d; Surprise said. Children always liked stories. &#x201c;About the Adult Conspiracy.&#x201d; Oops; she had meant to name some safe minor adventure, but her nervousness about the Conspiracy had made her misspeak. &#x201c;I mean&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, let&#x2019;s!&#x201d; both children exclaimed, picking up on it instantly. &#x201c;With every dirty detail,&#x201d; Ted concluded.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, I meant not about it,&#x201d; Surprise said desperately.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You said, you said!&#x201d; Monica chimed. &#x201c;Now we have to have it. Exactly how does it work?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>They were really trying to get her in trouble, and knew how to do it. How could she handle this?<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as if it is any mystery,&#x201d; the peeve said with a superior tone that was also Surprise&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;All that is required is for the man to take the woman and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare!&#x201d; Surprise said, conjuring a black hood that dropped over the bird&#x2019;s head and muffled it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!&#x201d; the peeve swore, the badness stifled by the hood. It flapped its wings, lifted into the air, did a loop, and dropped the hood to the floor, where it faded out. It opened its beak again.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;If you say one bad word, I&#x2019;ll lock you in a soundproof birdcage,&#x201d; Surprise warned it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t dare, you uppity wench!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A birdcage appeared next to the bird. It had thick sound-absorbent curtains.<br>&nbsp;<br>The peeve reconsidered. It had brushed with Surprise before, and learned that she could do just about anything once. If she abolished the birdcage, she would not be able to conjure it again. But she could conjure a very similar one, or a bandanna knotted about its beak, or a cloud of sneeze powder that would prevent its talking for several moments and some instants left over. Her magical ability was limited only by her imagination. She was in fact uncomfortably close to being Sorceress level, and might one day be recognized as such when she perfected her ability. That was why she was able to handle the demon children, and they too knew it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No bad words, harridan,&#x201d; the bird agreed, disgruntled.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Idea!&#x201d; Ted exclaimed, a bulb flashing brightly over his head. &#x201c;Have the peeve tell about the Adult Conspiracy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh, no&#x2014;they were back on that. No amount of magic could handle that violation if it happened. She had to change the subject in a hurry. But for the moment her mind was distressingly blank.<br>&nbsp;<br>Monica clapped her hands. &#x201c;I thought you were out of ideas, Ted, but that&#x2019;s a good one.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It is not a good idea,&#x201d; Surprise said. &#x201c;The peeve can&#x2019;t speak a sentence without insulting someone.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But the children knew they were onto something. &#x201c;Is that true, birdbrain?&#x201d; Ted asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, poop head. I just don&#x2019;t care to waste opportunity. I can cover every detail of the Adult Conspiracy without uttering a bad word.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Wonderful!&#x201d; Monica said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No you don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; Surprise said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make a laryngitis spell.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Awww,&#x201d; the children said together.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I can tell about it without violating it,&#x201d; the peeve insisted.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;See&#x2014;the bird&#x2019;s reformed,&#x201d; Ted said eagerly.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Under a pig&#x2019;s tail,&#x201d; the peeve said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never reform.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But you can really annoy Surprise if you make good on your pledge,&#x201d; Monica said with a canny glance. &#x201c;No bad words, no violation, but you cover the subject and she can&#x2019;t stop you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The peeve received her glance and sent it back. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not half as stupid as I took you for, Harmonica.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s DE-Monica, greenface. As in Demon-ica.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ick,&#x201d; the bird agreed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So it&#x2019;s decided,&#x201d; Ted said. &#x201c;The bird sings.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Surprise hesitated. The three were ganging up on her, but she was curious how the peeve could do what it said, and maybe it would help get them through until some more innocent distraction turned up. &#x201c;Very well. But the rules will be strictly enforced.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Absolutely, honey-pie,&#x201d; the bird agreed with her voice. But there was a shiftiness about its wings that suggested it was going to try to get away with something.<br>&nbsp;<br>The children sat on the floor facing the peeve&#x2019;s perch. Surprise set about making a snack for them all, but she kept a close ear on the bird. Nothing daunted it except a direct enforceable threat.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Long ago and far away,&#x201d; the peeve said, &#x201c;there was no such thing as the Adult Conspiracy. People summoned storks freely and no one cared. Children knew all about it, and watched when they wanted to. That was how they learned how to do it. But then confounded civilization arrived and messed up the natural order. Adults started concealing it, and setting other ridiculous rules such as not letting children hear the most effective words. It seems the adults were jealous of the carefree life of children, so decided to keep interesting things away from them.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hear hear,&#x201d; Ted agreed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Surprise did not see it quite the same way, but as long as the bird stayed clear of key words and concepts she couldn&#x2019;t protest.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There are also stories that the adults grew fearful of a revolution by the children, so acted to prevent it. After all, suppose children started summoning babies on their own? What further need would there be for adults? They might discover themselves superfluous, and be on track for elimination. They didn&#x2019;t like that, so decided to stop it before the children made their move.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s interesting,&#x201d; Monica said thoughtfully. &#x201c;Something should be done about it.&#x336;...</p><h2>Sisters of the Extreme: Women Writing on the Drug Experience</h2><p>� An anthology of writings by some of the most influential women in history on the often misunderstood and misrepresented female drug experience.<br><br>� With great honesty, bravery, and frankness, women from diverse backgrounds write about their drug experiences.<br><br>Women have been experimenting with drugs since prehistoric times, and yet published accounts of their views on the drug experience have been relegated to either antiseptic sociological studies or sensationalized stories splashed across the tabloids. The media has given us an enduring, but inaccurate, stereotype of a female drug user: passive, addicted, exploited, degraded, promiscuous. But the selections in this anthology--penned by such famous names as Billie Holiday, Anais Nin, Maya Angelou, and Carrie Fisher--show us that the real experiences of women are anything but stereotypical. <br><br><i>Sisters of the Extreme</i> provides us with writings by women from diverse occupations and backgrounds, from prostitute to physician, who through their use of drugs dared cross the boundaries set by society--often doing so with the hope of expanding themselves and their vision of the world. Whether with LSD, peyote, cocaine, heroine, MDMA, or marijuana, these women have sought to reach, through their experimentation, other levels of consciousness. Sometimes their quests have brought unexpected rewards, other times great suffering and misfortune. But wherever their trips have left them, these women have lived courageously--if sometimes dangerously--and written about their journeys eloquently.</p><p>WOMEN&#x2019;S STUDIES / PSYCHEDELICS <br> <br>&#x201c;A fascinating book.

An amazing and extensive collection of first-hand narratives of psychological and visionary importance.&#x201d; <br>--Joan Halifax, Author of <em>Shamanic Voices</em> <br> <br>&#x201c;The richness of subjective materials is exquisite. Many drug researchers tend to forget that the subjective experience is the raison d&#x2019;etre for drug use. Books like this one are an important counterbalance to the objective checklists of clinicians. The book contains some of the best expositions of sensory detail this reviewer has ever read.&#x201d; <br>--<em>Journal of Psychoactive Drugs</em> <br> <br><em>Sisters of the Extreme</em> captures the drug experiences of women from diverse times, social backgrounds, and professions in memoir, fiction, poetry, song, and art. From the mythic associations of ancient history and the rituals of indigenous peoples, through the rampant opiate intoxication of the Victorian era, to the junkies, psychedelic pioneers, anthropologists, and ravers of the late twentieth century, the selections in this book show us that the real experiences of women are far more compelling than antiseptic sociological studies or sensationalized tabloid accounts. <br> <br>Some of the contributors are after visions, revelations, and the healing powers of sacred plants while others are seekers of oblivion--addicts and abusers. Whether describing the effects of opium, LSD, peyote, mushrooms, ayahuasca, cocaine, heroin, MDMA, or marijuana, these women write about their experiences with power and eloquence. Through their experiments with drugs, they cross the boundaries set up by society: sometimes to escape, sometimes to search for deeper meaning, but always with a sense of adventure. <br> <br>Longtime drug historians, CYNTHIA PALMER and MICHAEL HOROWITZ are the directors of the Fitz Hugh Ludlow Memorial Library, the nation&#x2019;s largest private collection of drug literature.

Home-schooled, bound for the life of an educated Victorian lady, Nightingale scandalized her family when she found her calling as a nurse, a thoroughly unsuitable profession for a woman of her class. &nbsp;As the &#x201c;Lady with the Lamp,&#x201d; ministering to the wounded and dying of the Crimean War, she offers an enduring image of sentimental appeal. Few individuals in their own lifetime have reached the level of fame and adulation attained by Nightingale as a result of her efforts. Fewer still have the power of continuing to inspire controversy in the way she does almost a century after her death. &nbsp;In this remarkable book, the first major biography of Florence Nightingale in more than fifty years, Mark Bostridge draws on a wealth of unpublished material, including previously unseen family papers, to throw new light on this extraordinary woman&#x2019;s life and character. Disentangling elements of myth from the reality, Bostridge has written a vivid and immensely readable account of one of the most iconic figures in modern history.</p><p>Mark Bostridge&nbsp;was born in 1961 and was educated at Oxford University.

The Ridiculous Name of NightingaleTake a walk south from the Porta Romana in Florence today, along the Via Senese, then turn westwards, and you will soon find yourself climbing a steep path along a narrow winding road. High stone walls, mossy and mottled with age, obliterate the view in either direction, but tall cypress trees line the route, and olives and vines run down to the walls on both sides.Towards the summit, at a bend in the road, a large house comes into view. The Villa La Colombaia is now a convent junior school with an imposing modern stone fa�ade, but parts of the house date back to the fifteenth century. On its garden side the original low building with shuttered windows, arranged around a courtyard, is still in existence. A gravel walk through an elegantly laid-out garden leads to a magnificent view over the city, of Brunelleschi's white ribbed dome amid a sea of red rooftops.It was from this 'Maison de Campagne', on a spring day in 1820, that twenty-six-year-old William Nightingale wrote to his brother-in-law Ben Smith about the expected imminent arrival of his second child. The city of Florence itself seemed deserted -- everyone was travelling to Rome for Holy Week -- but William and his heavily pregnant wife Fanny were taking advantage of the fine weather to ride up and down the hillside, he on a pony, she in a carriage driven by grey horses.As William wrote his letter, his first child, Parthenope, born just a year before in Naples, was wriggling about on his knee, proving 'so rumbustical I can hardly scribble'. He was confident that the new baby would be a boy, though apologetic that he could not report 'by the same post the arrival of a young Ulysses, the protector of Parthenope ... He is expected every minute not to say moment, but delays his arrival I know not why ...'It would be a further five weeks before William Nightingale was able to announce the birth of another daughter.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>'I found a house at Florence on the hill/of Bellosguardo,' wrote Elizabeth Barrett Browning in <i>Aurora Leigh</i>. Walk on a short distance from the Villa La Colombaia, and the legendary beauty of this small area outside the city gates, which has attracted so many well-to-do and famous visitors through the centuries, is immediately apparent. A stone monument at the roadside records some of the distinguished names who have lived or stayed at Bellosguardo: among them, Galileo, who retreated here after his appearance before the Inquisition, James Fenimore Cooper, Nathaniel Hawthorne, the Brownings, Henry James, Clara Schumann and, the penultimate name on the list, above that of Violet Trefusis, Florence Nightingale.It is Henry James who provides the location of Florence Nightingale's birthplace with the link to a neat little biographical irony. For it was while staying, in 1887, at the Casa Brichieri-Colombi, another of the grand villas on the road leading to the brow of Bellosguardo, that James wrote the first draft of <i>The Aspern Papers.</i> James's novella, with its story of a would-be biographer who attempts to prise some letters of a famous American poet, Jeffrey Aspern, from an old woman, only to discover that she has burned them one by one, has been described as a moral fable for historians and biographers. It dramatizes the biographer's primordial fear: the destruction of the manuscript evidence, so vital to the craft, literally obliterated in a cloud of smoke.The contrast with the fate of Florence Nightingale's manuscripts could scarcely be greater. While not a scrap of the Aspern papers is left for posterity, Nightingale's biographer has to struggle hard not to be buried under a veritable mountain of material, to the extent that he may find himself occasionally wishing that the odd bonfire had actually taken place. Florence Nightingale was an inveterate hoarder. She preserved not only letters, diaries, personal notes and jottings, but also copies and drafts of letters -- and corrections of drafts. Identical, or almost identical, phrases in her letters sometimes make her seem like an actress rehearsing lines for a favourite role. At her death, paper was scattered through practically every corner of the first floor of her house at 10 South Street, even 'inside piano stools, behind coal scuttles, under sofas'. She had enough letters in her drawers, she had written in 1895, 'to cover Australia'.Today, the collection at the British Library, the second largest among personal archives after that of Gladstone, fills almost 200 bound volumes,and this represents merely the tip of the iceberg. At Claydon House in Buckinghamshire, the home for thirty years of Nightingale's sister Parthenope, Lady Verney, there is another massive collection, which includes Florence Nightingale's letters to her parents and sister, and correspondence between members of the extended Nightingale family network, over a period of more than a century. The London Metropolitan Archives are a third major Nightingale repository connected with the running of the nursing training school founded in Florence Nightingale's name at St Thomas's Hospital, in 1860. In addition to these, there are some 200 smaller holdings of Nightingale papers around the world. Although there are significant gaps in the records -- some sanctioned by Nightingale's family and executors, who destroyed certain letters after the appearance of the two authorized biographies by Sir Edward Cook and Ida O'Malley -- Florence Nightingale's life is one of the best documented of the Victorian age, certainly the best documented of any Victorian woman. And previously unknown letters continue to materialize, most dramatically during the Second World War, when it was only quick thinking on the part of some individual that prevented Nightingale's forty-seven surviving letters to one of her Crimean War colleagues, Reverend Mother Mary Clare Moore, from being burned during the attack by a V-2 rocket which destroyed the Convent of Mercy in Bermondsey.It might, though, have all turned out rather differently. As a young woman, in her first professional appointment, in 1853, as Superintendent of the Upper Harley Street Establishment for Gentlewomen during Illness, Florence Nightingale had conceived of a time when she might start keeping her letters, '&amp; after my death gratify the public with them'. Post-Crimea, however, and fame and influence made her more wary of the likely incursions of posterity, causing her to make radically different plans. 'Destroy', 'Return', 'Burn' are words which appear regularly from this time, scrawled across the upper left-hand corner of her letters. In 1860 she begged Henry (later Cardinal) Manning to burn her letters to him, adding that 'I have alas! met with such treachery in my poor life that any carelessness on the part of those I know to be friendly to me might easily be turned to bad account'; and four years later she recorded in a private note that she had 'taken effectual means' that 'all my papers' would be destroyed after her death. A clause in Nightingale's will of 1896 confirmed this arrangement. She 'earnestly entreated' her friendsand executors that all her letters, papers and manuscripts, with the exception of those relating to her work for India, be destroyed 'without examination'. Five years later she changed her mind. She still believed that the majority of her papers should be destroyed, but she was bequeathing them to her cousin Henry Bonham Carter, leaving him with the difficult decision of what to preserve. Evidently he couldn't bring himself to effect their mass destruction either.Why did Nightingale change her mind? She was certainly not oblivious to the threat posed by biography. 'I earnestly wish that no ... biography of me should be given by my family or friends,' she insisted in 1862 when the onset of severe spinal pain made her 'impatient for death'. Thirty years later, she joked, 'Well might Sir Cornwall Lewis say: "A new terror is added to death",' after learning that her letters to Sidney Herbert had been lent to his biographer, Lord Stanmore, without her consent. Yet she allowed plenty of material that was damaging to her own reputation to survive.1In the end its survival may simply be attributed to the fact that, towards the end of her life, Nightingale lacked the time and energy to embark on such a massive process of sorting and disposal. Alternatively, it could be seen as an expression of a lifelong inner conflict between a natural desire for recognition, and a deep religious conviction that she must walk invisible and avoid the snares and delusions of self-love. Or it may be that writing itself was so much a part of her identity that ultimately she could not bear to see her literary remains consigned to the flames.For writing was Florence Nightingale's lifeblood. This was a woman, after all, who even while in the depths of delirium in the Crimea, in May 1855, insisted on being brought pen and paper, and only with these in her possession did ...</p><h2>Thunderstruck</h2><p>A true story of love, murder, and the end of the world&#x2019;s &#x201c;great hush&#x201d;<br><br>In <i>Thunderstruck</i>, Erik Larson tells the interwoven stories of two men&#x2014;Hawley Crippen, a very unlikely murderer, and Guglielmo Marconi, the obsessive creator of a seemingly supernatural means of communication&#x2014;whose lives intersect during one of the greatest criminal chases of all time.<br><br>Set in Edwardian London and on the stormy coasts of Cornwall, Cape Cod, and Nova Scotia, <i>Thunderstruck</i> evokes the dynamism of those years when great shipping companies competed to build the biggest, fastest ocean liners, scientific advances dazzled the public with visions of a world transformed, and the rich outdid one another with ostentatious displays of wealth. Against this background, Marconi races against incredible odds and relentless skepticism to perfect his invention: the wireless, a prime catalyst for the emergence of the world we know today. Meanwhile, Crippen, &#x201c;the kindest of men,&#x201d; nearly commits the perfect crime.<br><br>With his superb narrative skills, Erik Larson guides these parallel narratives toward a relentlessly suspenseful meeting on the waters of the North Atlantic. Along the way, he tells of a sad and tragic love affair that was described on the front pages of newspapers around the world, a chief inspector who found himself strangely sympathetic to the killer and his lover, and a driven and compelling inventor who transformed the way we communicate. <i>Thunderstruck</i> presents a vibrant portrait of an era of s�ances, science, and fog, inhabited by inventors, magicians, and Scotland Yard detectives, all presided over by the amiable and fun-loving Edward VII as the world slid inevitably toward the first great war of the twentieth century. Gripping from the first page, and rich with fascinating detail about the time, the people, and the new inventions that connect and divide us, <i>Thunderstruck</i> is splendid narrative history from a master of the form.</p><p>Erik Larson is the bestselling author of the National Book Award finalist and Edgar Award&#x2013;winning <i>The Devil in the White City</i>.

Though one of Britain&#x2019;s most august scientific bodies, it occupied a building of modest proportion, only three floors. The false columns affixed to its facade were an afterthought, meant to impart a little grandeur. It housed a lecture hall, a laboratory, living quarters, and a bar where members could gather to discuss the latest scientific advances. <br>Inside the hall, a physicist of great renown readied himself to deliver the evening&#x2019;s presentation. He hoped to startle his audience, certainly, but otherwise he had no inkling that this lecture would prove the most important of his life and a source of conflict for decades to come. His name was Oliver Lodge, and really the outcome was his own fault&#x2014; another manifestation of what even he acknowledged to be a fundamental flaw in how he approached his work. In the moments remaining before his talk, he made one last check of an array of electrical apparatus positioned on a demonstration table, some of it familiar, most unlike anything seen before in this hall. <br>Outside on Albemarle Street the police confronted their usual traffic problem. Scores of carriages crowded the street and gave it the look of a great black seam of coal. While the air in the surrounding neighborhood of Mayfair was scented with lime and the rich cloying sweetness of hothouse flowers, here the street stank of urine and manure, despite the efforts of the young, red-shirted &#x201c;street orderlies&#x201d; who moved among the horses collecting ill-timed deposits. Officers of the Metropolitan Police directed drivers to be quick about exiting the street once their passengers had departed. The men wore black, the women gowns. <br>Established in 1799 for the &#x201c;diffusion of knowledge, and facilitating the general introduction of useful mechanical improvements,&#x201d; the Royal Institution had been the scene of great discoveries. Within its laboratories Humphry Davy had found sodium and potassium and devised the miner&#x2019;s safety lamp, and Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction, the phenomenon whereby electricity running through one circuit induces a current in another. The institution&#x2019;s lectures, the &#x201c;Friday Evening Discourses,&#x201d; became so popular, the traffic outside so chaotic, that London officials were forced to turn Albemarle into London&#x2019;s first one-way street. <br>Lodge was a professor of physics at the new University College of Liverpool, where his laboratory was housed in a space that once had been the padded cell of a lunatic asylum. At first glance he seemed the embodiment of established British science. He wore a heavy beard misted with gray, and his head&#x2014;&#x201c;the great head,&#x201d; as a friend put it&#x2014;was eggshell bald to a point just above his ears, where his hair swept back into a tangle of curls. He stood six feet three inches tall and weighed about 210 pounds. A young woman once reported that the experience of dancing with Lodge had been akin to dancing with the dome of St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral. <br>Though considered a kind man, in his youth Lodge had exhibited a cruel vein that, as he grew older, caused him regret and astonishment. While a student at a small school, Combs Rectory, he had formed a club, the Combs Rectory Birds&#x2019; Nest Destroying Society, whose members hunted nests and ransacked them, smashing eggs and killing fledglings, then firing at the parent birds with slingshots. Lodge recalled once beating a dog with a toy whip but dismissed this incident as an artifact of childhood cruelty. &#x201c;Whatever faults I may have,&#x201d; he wrote in his memoir, &#x201c;cruelty is not one of them; it is the one thing that is utterly repugnant.&#x201d; <br>Lodge had come of age during a time when scientists began to coax from the mists a host of previously invisible phenomena, particularly in the realm of electricity and magnetism. He recalled how lectures at the Royal Institution would set his imagination alight. &#x201c;I have walked back through the streets of London, or across Fitzroy Square, with a sense of unreality in everything around, an opening up of deep things in the universe, which put all ordinary objects of sense into the shade, so that the square and its railings, the houses, the carts, and the people, seemed like shadowy unrealities, phantasmal appearances, partly screening, but partly permeated by, the mental and spiritual reality behind.&#x201d; <br>The Royal Institution became for Lodge &#x201c;a sort of sacred place,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;where pure science was enthroned to be worshipped for its own sake.&#x201d; He believed the finest science was theoretical science, and he scorned what he and other like-minded scientists called &#x201c;practicians,&#x201d; the new heathen, inventors and engineers and tinkerers who eschewed theoretical research for blind experimentation and whose motive was commercial gain. Lodge once described the patent process as &#x201c;inappropriate and repulsive.&#x201d; <br>As his career advanced, he too was asked to deliver Friday Evening Discourses, and he reveled in the opportunity to put nature&#x2019;s secrets on display. When a scientific breakthrough occurred, he tried to be first to bring it to public notice, a pattern he had begun as early as 1877, when he acquired one of the first phonographs and brought it to England for a public demonstration, but his infatuation with the new had a corollary effect: a vulnerability to distraction. He exhibited a lofty dilettantism that late in life he acknowledged had been a fatal flaw. &#x201c;As it is,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;I have taken an interest in many subjects, and spread myself over a considerable range&#x2014;a procedure which, I suppose, has been good for my education, though not so prolific of results.&#x201d; Whenever his scientific research threatened to lead to a breakthrough, he wrote, &#x201c;I became afflicted with a kind of excitement which caused me to pause and not pursue that path to the luminous end. . . . It is an odd feeling, and has been the cause of my not clinching many subjects, not following up the path on which I had set my feet.&#x201d; <br>To the dismay of peers, one of his greatest distractions was the world of the supernatural. He was a member of the Society for Psychical&nbsp; Research, established in 1882 by a group of level-headed souls, mostly scientists and philosophers, to bring scientific scrutiny to ghosts, s�ances, telepathy, and other paranormal events, or as the society stated in each issue of its Journal, &#x201c;to examine without prejudice or prepossession and in a scientific spirit, those faculties of man, real or supposed, which appear to be inexplicable on any generally recognized hypothesis.&#x201d; The society&#x2019;s constitution stated that membership did not imply belief in &#x201c;physical forces other than those recognized by Physical Science.&#x201d; That the SPR had a Committee on Haunted Houses deterred no one. Its membership expanded quickly to include sixty university dons and some of the brightest lights of the era, among them John Ruskin, H. G. Wells, William E. Gladstone, Samuel Clemens (better known as Mark Twain), and the Rev. C. L. Dodgson (with the equally prominent pen name Lewis Carroll). The roster also listed Arthur Balfour, a future prime minister of England, and William James, a pioneer in psychology, who by the summer of 1894 had been named the society&#x2019;s president. <br>It was Lodge&#x2019;s inquisitiveness, not a belief in ghosts, that first drove him to become a member of the SPR. The occult was for him just one more invisible realm worthy of exploration, the outermost province of the emerging science of psychology. The unveiling during Lodge&#x2019;s life of so many hitherto unimagined physical phenomena, among them Heinrich Hertz&#x2019;s discovery of electromagnetic waves, suggested to him that the world of the mind must harbor secrets of its own. The fact that waves could travel through the ether seemed to confirm the existence of another plane of reality. If one could send electromagnetic waves through the ether, was it such an outrageous next step to suppose that the spiritual essence of human beings, an electromagnetic soul, might also exist within the ether and thus explain the hauntings and spirit rappings that had become such a fixture of common legend? Reports of ghosts inhabiting country houses, poltergeists rattling abbeys, spirits knocking on tables during s�ances&#x2014;all these in the eyes of Lodge and fellow members of the society seemed as worthy of dispassionate analysis as the invisible travels of an electromagnetic wave. <br>Within a few years of his joining the SPR, however, events challenged Lodge&#x2019;s ability to maintain his scientific remove. In Boston William James began hearing from his own family about a certain &#x201c;Mrs. Piper&#x201d;&#x2014;Lenore Piper&#x2014;a medium who was gaining notoriety for possessing strange powers. Intending to expose her as a fraud, James arranged a sitting and found himself enthralled. He suggested that the society invite Mrs. Piper to England for a series of experiments. She and her two daughters sailed to Liverpool in November 1889 and then traveled to Cambridge, where a sequence of sittings took place under the close observation of SPR members. Lodge arranged a sitting of his own and suddenly found himself listening to his dead aunt Anne, a beloved woman of lively intellect who had abetted his drive to become a scientist against the wishes of his father. She once had told Lodge that after her death she would come back to visit if she could, and now, in a voice he remembered, she reminded him of that promise. &#x201c;This,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;was an unusual thing to happen.&#x201d; <br>To Lodge, the encounter seemed proof that some part of the human mind persisted even after death. It left him, he wrote, &#x201c;thoroughly convinced not only of human survival, but of the power to ...</p><h2>Royal&#39;s Bride (The Bride Trilogy)</h2><p><br><br><strong>Though he is a tilted nobleman, Royal Dewar is singularly unlucky...forced to choose between his soul mate and his salvation.</strong><br><br>After years abroad, Royal has returned to Bransford Castle to find his father dying and the family treasury nearly empty.

As he strode past the main drawing room, so impressive with its high, Tudor-style ceilings and heavy beams, he tried to ignore the worn Persian carpets, the way the bright reds and vivid blues he recalled from his youth had faded to shadowy, lackluster hues.<br><br>As he climbed the wide, carved mahogany staircase, he tried not to notice the feel of the wooden banister beneath his hand, once polished to a rich patina but now dull from years of neglect.<br><br>He had been home for less than two weeks, returned to England from his family's plantation, Sugar Reef, in Barbados, where he had been living for the past seven years. His father had fallen ill and the family solicitor, Mr. Edward Pinkard, had sent for him.<br><br><em>The Duke ofBransford is dying, </em>the letter had said. <em>In all haste, my lord, please come home before it is too late.</em><br><br>He was home at last, grateful to have this brief time with his father, but the house was dreary and in desperate need of repair, and he was unused to being cooped up inside. At dawn, after checking on his father's condition, he had headed for the stables. He hadn't ridden Bransford lands in the past eight years and he looked forward to becoming reacquainted with his home.<br><br>Though the winter wind was chill, the sky gray and cloudy, Royal enjoyed the ride immensely, surprising himself a bit. The hot climate of Barbados had seeped into his bones and his skin was sun-darkened from his work out in the sugarcane fields. Yet this morning, with the brisk wind in his face and the open fields stretching as far as he could see, he realized how much he had missed England.<br><br>It was late morning when he returned to the house, swinging down from the big gray stallion that had been a gift on his twenty-first birthday, a colt he had named Jupiter that now stood seventeen hands high. He handed the reins to a waiting groom.<br><br>"See he gets an extra ration of oats, will you, Jimmy?"<br><br>"Aye, my lord."<br><br>Feeling only a little guilty for leaving with his father so ill, Royal hurried into the house and climbed the stairs to the second floor. Striding down the hall, he paused for a moment to collect himself outside the door to the duke's bedroom suite.<br><br>A strip of light seeped from beneath the heavy wooden panel, indicating a lamp burned inside. Royal turned the silver handle, opened the door and strode into the massive, dimly lit chamber. Across the room, his father lay beneath the covers of a huge four-poster bed encased in heavy gold velvet hangings, the shell of the man he had once been.<br><br>The duke's valet and most trusted servant, George Mid-dleton, hurried forward on long, spindly legs, his shoulders stooped from years of service and now resignation.<br><br>"It is good you are back, my lord."<br><br>"How is he, Middleton?" Royal pulled the tie on his long scarlet woolen cloak and allowed the valet to sweep it from his shoulders.<br><br>"I am afraid, my lord, each day he grows weaker. Waiting for Lord Reese to arrive is all that keeps him going."<br><br>Royal nodded. He prayed his brother, two years younger than his own twenty-nine years and a major in the British cavalry, would reach Bransford before it was too late. His third and youngest brother, Rule, had already arrived, home from his studies at Oxford.<br><br>Royal glanced toward the velvet curtains and saw Rule sitting in the shadows next to their father's bedside. Rule rose and started forward. Tall and broad-shouldered with the lean-muscled build of an athlete, Rule looked a good deal like his siblings: same straight nose, carved features and solid jaw, but unlike Royal, who had the dark blond hair and golden-brown eyes of their mother, both Reese and Rule were black-haired, with the brilliant blue eyes that belonged to the duke.<br><br>"He's been asking for you." Rule moved into the flickering light of the lamp on a nearby rosewood dresser, the dangling prisms throwing off a rainbow of colors. "He's been rambling a bit. He says there is a promise you must make. He says he cannot die in peace unless you vow to see it done."<br><br>Royal nodded, more curious than concerned. All three brothers loved their father. And all three had abandoned him years ago to follow their own selfish dreams. They owed the Duke of Bransford. His sons would do whatever he asked of them.<br><br>Following in Middleton's wake, his brother strode past Royal out the door and closed it softly behind him, leaving him alone in the gloomy, airless room. His father had suffered three separate strokes, the first three years ago, and each more debilitating than the last. Royal should have come back to England after the first, but his father's letters had assured him of his recovery, and Royal had wanted to believe it. He wanted to stay at Sugar Reef.<br><br>He looked down at the frail old man on the bed, once a man of unbelievable power and strength. It was sheer force of will, Royal believed, that had kept his father alive this long.<br><br>"Royal...?"<br><br>He moved to the bed, settled himself in the chair his youngest brother had vacated. "I'm right here, Father." He reached out and clasped the duke's thin, cold hand. Though it was warm in the bedroom, he made a mental note to stoke up the flames in the hearth.<br><br>"I am sorry... my son," the duke said in a raspy voice, "for the poor legacy... I have left you. I have failed you... and your... brothers."<br><br>"It's all right, Father. Once you are back on your feet&#x2014;"<br><br>"Do not talk... nonsense, boy." He took a few wheezing breaths, his mouth drooping slightly, and Royal fell silent. "I've lost it all. I am not... not even sure exactly how it happened. Somehow it just... slipped away."<br><br>Royal didn't have to ask what his father meant. The furniture missing from the drawing rooms, the bare spots on the walls where exquisite gilt-framed paintings once had hung, the general dilapidated condition of what had once been one of the grandest houses in England told the story.<br><br>"In time, our fortune can be rebuilt," Royal said. "The Bransford dukedom will be as mighty as it ever was."<br><br>"Yes... I am certain it will be." He coughed, dragged in a shaky breath. "I know I can... count on you, Royal... you and your brothers. But it won't be easy."<br><br>"I will see it done, Father, I promise you."<br><br>"And so you... shall. And I am going to help you... even after I am dead and buried."<br><br>Royal's chest squeezed. He knew his father was going to die. It was only a matter of time. Still, it was difficult to accept that a man once as strong and vital as the duke would actually be gone.<br><br>"Did you hear what I said... Royal?"<br><br>He had, but only dimly. "Yes, Father, but I'm afraid I don't know what you mean."<br><br>"There is a way...my son. The simplest...of ways. Marriage to the right woman will give you... the money you need." His frail hold tightened on Royal's hand. "I have found her, son. The perfect... woman."<br><br>Royal straightened in his chair, certain his father must have returned to his former rambling.<br><br>"She is beautiful..." the duke continued. "An exquisite creature... worthy of becoming your duchess." The old man's strength seemed to grow with every word, and for a moment, the dull glaze over his eyes lifted, turning them the fierce blue of his youth. "She is an heiress, my boy...inherited a fortune from her grandfather. And the size of her dowry is incredible. You will be a wealthy man again."<br><br>"You should rest. I can come back&#x2014;"<br><br>"Listen to me, son. I have already spoken to her... father, a man named Henry Caulfield. Caulfield dotes on her. He is determined... to give her a title. The arrangements have already... been made." He wheezed in a breath, coughed, but his hold on Royal's hand never weakened. "After a suitable period of mourning... you will marry Jocelyn Caulfield. With her fortune...and your resolve... you can rebuild the house and return our lands to their former glory."<br><br>The duke's grip grew fierce. Royal was amazed he had that much strength. And he realized his father wasn't rambling. Indeed, he knew exactly what he was saying. "Promise me you will do it. Say you will marry the girl."<br><br>Royal's heart was thumping oddly. He owed his father, yet deep inside, some part of him wanted to refuse, to rebel against a life that had been dictated for him. Though he had been trained to assume the duties of duke, he hadn't expected to face those duties so soon.<br><br>His mind rushed backward. At two-and-twenty, he had hied himself off to adventure in the Caribbean. He had taken over the running of the family plantation. The vast acreage had been of little value when he had assumed the role as owner. Through hours of back-breaking labor, he had created a domain he could be proud of, made the plantation the success it was today.<br><br>He had known one day he would be called back home. He had known he would face responsibilities beyond anything he had handled in the past.<br><br>But he hadn't expected his father to die so soon.<br><br>Or to inherit a title and lands that had been stripped completely bare.<br><br>His father's grip slackened, his energy drained. The corner of his mouth drooped as it had before. "Promise me..."<br><br>Royal swallowed. His father was dying. How could he refuse his dying wish?<br><br>"Please..." the duke whispered.<br><br>"I will marry her, Father, as you wish. You have my word."<br><br>The duke made a faint nod of his head. A slow breath whispered out and his eyes slowly closed. For an instant, Royal feared he was dead. Then his chest weakly inflated, and Royal felt a sweep of relief. Releasing his father's cold hand, he slipped it beneath the covers and eased away from the bed. He paused long enough to build up the fire, then left the suite.<br><br>As he stepped outside, he spotted Rule pacing the hallway. His brother jerked to a halt as Royal quietly closed the door.<br><br>"Is he...?"<br><br>"He is as he was." He released a breath. "He has arranged a marriage. The woman comes with an enormous dowry, enough to begin rebuilding the family lands and holdings. I have agreed to the match."<br><br>Rule frowned, drawing his black eyebrows together. "Are you certain that is what you wish to do?"<br><br>Royal's mouth barely curved. "I am not sure of anything, brother, except that I have made a vow and now I must keep it."<br><br>***<br><br>The burial of the Duke of Bransford took place on a windy, overcast, frigid morning in January. The proceedings had actually begun several days earlier, with a lengthy funeral service given by the Archbishop at Westminster Abbey. It was attended by a score of nobles and dozens of London's elite.<br><br>Afterward, the coffin was transported to the village of Bransford via an extravagant black carriage and four matching black horses for a graveside service and the final interment of the late duke's body in the family's private plot adjacent to the village church.<br><br>A number of family members were in attendance, including the duke's aging aunt, Agatha Edgewood, Dowager Countess of Tavistock, as well as numerous other aunts and cousins, some Royal hadn't known existed. Some, like vultures, had come to discover if they might receive a bequest in the late duke's will. Those few had a surprise in store for them since little unentailed property or monies remained in the family coffers.<br><br>Royal stared down at the gleaming bronze casket that held his father's remains and a thick lump swelled in his throat. He should have come home sooner, should have spent more time with the man who had sired him. He should have helped him manage his vast affairs. Perhaps if he had, the dukedom wouldn't have fallen into ruin. Perhaps his father wouldn't have worried himself into an early grave.<br><br>Royal gazed at the coffin, which blurred for an instant behind a film of tears. His father was gone. The sixth Duke of Bransford had passed away peacefully two hours after the arrival of his middle son.<br><br>Reese and the duke had been cosseted together briefly, and another vow was made. By no later than the date his twelve-year enlistment was up, Reese would leave the military and return to Wiltshire. He would take over the lands and manor at Briarwood, a nearby property Reese had inherited from their maternal grandfather. He would rebuild those lands and make them and his life productive.<br><br>Reese, the most stubborn of the duke's three offspring, enjoyed his freedom, his military life and his travels. He wanted nothing less than being bound to a chunk of land he saw as a place that would hold him prisoner. But in the end, as his father's life drained away before his very eyes, Reese had agreed.<br><br>Rule, the wildest and least responsible, had made his pledge before Royal arrived. The duke believed an alliance with the Americans was in the family's best interest. His youngest son had pledged to do whatever it took to make that alliance a fact.<br><br>The vicar's words cut into Royal's thoughts, turning them away from events of the past few weeks and returning him to the words being said over his father's coffin.<br><br>A sharp wind tossed his long woolen cloak and cut through his heavy black tailcoat and dark gray trousers as he stood at the graveside. Next to him, Reese wore the scarlet-and-white dress uniform of a major in the British cavalry, the breeze slashing at his thick, wavy black hair. He was the most sober of the brothers, his features harder, reflecting the life he lived.<br><br>Royal's gaze moved to his youngest brother. Rule had been an unexpected addition to the family, born almost six years after Reese to a mother in ill health who had been warned against having more children. Amanda Dewar had died in childbirth, leaving Rule in the dubious care of a nanny, his two older brothers and a father who often drank to bury his grief or hid himself away in his study.<br><br>Rule had survived to become the most reckless of the three. He had a reputation as an incorrigible rake and he wore it proudly. He loved the ladies and seemed to make it a personal challenge to bed as many beautiful women as he possibly could.<br><br>Royal almost smiled. His own future had already been decided. He would marry a woman named Jocelyn Caulfield. A woman he had yet to meet. She was out of the country at present, enjoying a European tour with her mother. Royal was glad.<br><br>The period of mourning for his father would last a year. There would be time enough to arrange a marriage after that.<br><br></p><h2>Afghanistan: The Bear Trap: The Defeat of a Superpower</h2><p>How did the horrendous situation in Afghanistan, with all its implications for recent events and the present time, come to pass?

Let me take you on a journey beyond imagining. Let me tell you a story.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Amazon Guest Review: Amy Tan</b><br> <p></p> I&#x2019;ve been a huge fan of Rabih Alameddine's work for many years, beginning with his first novel, <i>Koolaids: The Art of War</i>. Rabih is not only a writer whose work I admire, he is also the writer with whom I have spent the most time talking about books, writers, and literary ideas. He reads the most international fiction of anyone else I know. And for now, his French is better than mine&#x2014;though I&#x2019;m working on that. . . . <p></p> Rabih is what I would call a writer of conscience, of self-consciousness, of subconsciouness, of the great big global unconscious. Within his stories are provocative ideas, housed in fractured narratives, splendid images, daring language&#x2014;and simply great storytelling. What some might call disjointed narratives, I think of as the way our perceptions of time and space actually unfurl themselves: not linearly, but in a revelatory sense. In <i>The Hakawati</i>, you are often set on a fabulist path, astride a horse, in the echoing halls of an emir&#x2019;s palace, a mythic time and place&#x2014;but suddenly, it feels as if the emir is ringing your own doorbell as you read, asking if he can borrow a bale of hay for his horse. <p></p> <i>The Hakawati</i> is already becoming known by both readers and critics as an important, timely story. In part it&#x2019;s because of the way the book integrates ancient tales from the Middle East into the lives of one unforgettable family. But it is also because of the upheavals--the violence--taking place in Lebanon today. Fiction has always been part of the wake of real political events. People read fiction, it seems to me, to understand the truth. And they will read <i>The Hakawati</i> to have a connection to those events--to the turmoil faced by real people not only in Lebanon but all across the Middle East. In fiction you can immerse your imagination in someone else's imagination. You are with characters the writer has imagined, and you are living beside them; they operate as your guides to life. By the end of the book, you love those characters. You have a profound interest in where they live. That's what Rabih has done in <i>The Hakawati</i> with Lebanon. It is no longer merely a fictional place, no longer a place you simply read about, or see on television, in the news. <p></p> Yet <i>The Hakawati</i> is not only timely in that sense: it is a timeless novel. In the world of ideas, fabulist tales are the foundations of many religions, including those in the Middle East, be they Jewish, Christian, Sunni, Shiite, Druze. These tales generally start off with the same kings and genies, the same men and women who are cast out to solve a riddle, slay a monster, or bring back proof of paternity or the death of an enemy, or what have you. Then there are "revisionist" versions of the fabulist tales, because no writer can keep his or her hands off a story to make it his or her own. And so throughout the history of religion, these stories have gathered permutations. And these permutations have gathered followers and enemies. But soon a set of fabulist tales becomes the Tales of the True Believers, and religion itself becomes the one reality. Therein lies the source of conflict, and of so much bloody war. In <i>The Hakawati</i>, some of the bloody parts resonate in tragic ways, while in others they are amplified, magnified, often in bizarre and even in bizarrely humorous fashion, as if to poke fun at the seriousness in which people treat these details. <p></p> Interwoven with the historical/fabulist stories in <i>The Hakawati</i> are other stories--those about one singular family's past. Invariably, as in any family's stories, there are secrets, scandals, something changed to fit what was best for the family reputation. Intersecting with the lore of the family's background is a narrative of what one man, Osama al-Kharrat, is experiencing now: the imminent death of his father; the reunion of relatives; his own shifting sense of home; the revisiting of relationships misappropriated and unwound--all tied back together in kaleidoscopic ways. <p></p> And it's not only the stories themselves that Alameddine is after: it's the nature of stories generally: this is what is at the heart of <i>The Hakawati</i>. Our own lives are narratives; they don&#x2019;t exist on a single flat plane. They include the influences of myths, fables, reconstructed moral tales. They include the untold stories of our ancestors. They include supposition and hypotheses, bias, and grudge, sentimentality and affection. <i>The Hakawati</i> takes these myriad gorgeous threads and reweaves them brilliantly. <p></p> And did I mention language? Usually, I know I'll like a book from the very first page. I can tell by the language. It shines and hums. It has imagery that makes me see more deeply. The characters say surprising things that are also perfectly true. And within the sentences I find knowledge, deep-seated and intelligent, brimming with an understanding of history, of character, or literature, of humor. From the very first lines of <i>The Hakawati</i>: "Listen. Allow me to be your god. Let me take you on a journey beyond imagining. Let me tell you a story," I knew this would be a book like that for me. <p></p> I could go on and on ... but let me simply add one more thing. I am a good predictor of who will win prizes. And I am predicting major prizes for <i>The Hakawati</i>. And for Rabih, I am predicting the biggest of prizes one day. The Nobel in both Literature and Peace. I&#x2019;m only half-kidding. For that reason alone, you should click and buy not just one copy, but several. If this book wins those prizes, then your edition today will be worth so much more later, especially when your friends see you had the perspicacity to recognize a good story when you heard one. As I wrote in my endorsement for the novel, "Rabih Alameddine is the hakawati, and in the very near future, everyone will know how to pronounce his name." <p></p> <i>--Amy Tan</i> <br><br><b>Rabih Alameddine</b> is the author of <i>Koolaids</i>, <i>The Perv</i>, and <i>I, the Divine</i>.

He has been a professional historian since 1973 and has written eighteen books, including <i>The City of London </i>(1994-2001), a widely acclaimed four-volume history, and WG's Birthday Party, an account of the Gentleman v.

He is the author of <i>Austerity Britain 1945-51</i> and <i>Family Britain 1951-57</i>, the first two titles in a series of books covering the history of post-war Britain (1945-1979) under the collective title 'Tales of a New Jerusalem'. He is currently a visiting professor at Kingston University.</p>Volumes full of treasure, serious history with a human face * <b>Hilary Mantel, <i>Observer</i>, Summer Reads</b> * The most ambitious and the most diligent ... These lists are sometimes so extensive and artfully arranged that they acquire a kind of lyrical beauty in their own right ... The guiding principle of this method is not postmodern relativism but a generous and open-minded inclusiveness ... As a rule, Kynaston shows enormous self-restraint: he assembles and presents his material with such studied neutrality that it's not obvious, at first, where his own loyalties lie ... If Kynaston's Tales of a New Jerusalem helps us to do that - if it succeeds in its objective of showing us, on a scale both panoramic and intimate, exactly what the postwar governments struggled to build, and which Thatcher, just as determinedly, sought to dismantle - then it will surely come to be seen not just as one of the present era's most important histories, but as one of the most illuminating works of literature * <b>Jonathan Coe, <i>Prospect</i></b> * David Kynaston's brilliant and witty chronicle of post-war Britain shows why he's The Past Master ... As wonderfully quick-witted and wide-ranging as its predecessors ... Kynaston peppers his book with these illuminating little vignettes ... I was struck by how skilfully he weaves it all together, beautifully intertwining anecdotes and observations with sparkling details and fascinating statistics ... Modernity Britain is both even-handed and exhilarating, a rare combination. Kynaston's sympathies are, broadly speaking, with the underdog, but he is wary of certainties, distrustful of the pat remedy. When he expresses overt opinions, they are always thoughtful, and arrive like thunder-flashes, illuminating the pages around them ... Was ever a history book so authoritative and, at the same time, quite so entertaining? Kynaston is particularly brilliant at filleting contemporary books, newspapers, comedy scripts, advertisement, films, political speeches, etc, for the telling quotation * <b>Craig Brown, <i>Mail on Sunday</i></b> * Kynaston's many fans will be pleased to hear that Modernity Britain has all the virtues of his previous volumes ... Kynaston has an unrivalled eye for long-forgotten, apparently banal and yet weirdly suggestive anecdotes ... Above all, Kynaston is a historian of tremendous compassion ... Perhaps the most moving section of Kynaston's splendid book, though, is his discussion of British schools in the late 1950s * <b>Dominic Sandbrook, <i>The Times</i></b> * The entertainment flies off the pages. The Kynaston method of compiling a vast array of sources and applying them with equal zest to the momentous ... and the ephemeral ... guarantees a rattling read. This is social, cultural and political history, more or less in that order, with a smile on its face ... Mostly he launches bombardments of facts, quotes, stories and numbers interspersed with pithy and shrewd editorial observations. He more than gets away with it ... There are brilliant passages throughout about the dispersion of inner-city tenant dwellers ... Kynaston specialises in fair-mindedness and nuance ... Much of the sheer and abundant joy of this book are its serendipity ... Hundreds of other wonders and absurdities captured and recreated for our enlightenment and entertainment * <b><i>New Statesman</i></b> * From high-rise flats to the Carry On films, here are the never-had-it-so-good years brought vividly to life by a historian whose extraordinary appetite for research seems to know bounds * <b>Rachel Cooke, <i>Observer</i></b> * Kynaston is a wonderful writer and his technique of creating a collage of diary extracts, newspaper commentaries and personal reminiscences, interspersed with historical description, acts to subtly disguise the force of his own analysis * <b><i>The Times</i> Book of the Week</b> * The narrative is beautifully composed and Kynaston digs deeper than previous historians ... One of the great virtues of Kynaston's approach is the juxtaposition of political rhetoric and social reality * <b><i>Literary Review</i></b> * Kynaston is the most readable and original social historian writing today and I've barely scratched the surface of what his latest compulsive book includes. Buy it * <i><b>Daily Express</b></i> * His forte is a beguiling use of social insights, often on an intimate domestic scale, to establish a sense of period and to open windows on the recent past * <b>Peter Clarke, <i>Financial Times</i></b> * David Kynaston resembles a novelist impersonating a historian. His books read like fiction disguised as documentary ... His method evokes the sumptuous messiness of human experience. He depicts history as an unfolding, ill-managed pageant ... His books so enriching, improving and endearing ... Shrewd, funny and ever-readable ... In Kynaston's history books, the reader can hear the people speak. He has an elocutionist's sense of people's diction * <b><i>Guardian</i></b> * Artful deployment of different voices and sources vividly evokes a time when benighted extremes of snobbery and hate-speech coexisted with increasing working-class confidence * <b><i>Observer</i></b> * Kynaston is a historian who likes to get out of the way. You seldom read a decisive judgment or a grand-sweeping generalisation. Rather, he rummages in the attic and pulls a whole clattering cavalcade of interesting junk down on himself ... Among his many virtues are his thoroughness and attention to detail * <b>Sam Leith, <i>Spectator</i></b> * Superb ... Modernity Britain is an outstanding book, a delightful and often funny mix of the profound and the mundane that presents an enormously instructive glimpse into a time when supermarkets, Carry On films and Galaxy bars were cutting edge ... Kynaston possesses unique sensitivity to their meaning * <b><i>Sunday Telegraph</i></b> * Wholly absorbing work * <b><i>Independent on Sunday</i></b> * Kynaston is brilliant and funny * <b>Charles Moore, <i>Daily Telegraph</i></b> * His look behind the curtain and his detailing of the rich quotidian details of the recent past says everything about how we live now ... The striking thing about Modernity Britain is the parallels that Kynaston allows us to quickly draw * <i><b>Big Issue in Scotland</b></i> * Portrait of Britain on the verge of change in the late 1950s * <b><i>Sunday Times</i></b> * Wonderful history * <i><b>Daily Telegraph</b></i> * David Kynaston's monumental history ... Kynaston shows, with his customary finesse and kaleidoscopic range of sources * <b><i>Independent on Sunday</i></b> * Unrivalled eye for detail in this arresting portrait of Britain * <b><i>Sunday Times</i> Summer Reads</b> * This is the latest volume in the historian's acclaimed series about Britain since 1945, Tales of a New Jerusalem. Focusing on the years of Harold Macmillan's first government, it echoes with the diverse voices of 1950s Britain, from Surbiton house-wives ("Why should I spend all morning making scones?") to Enoch Powell's nationalist rhetoric. It is a shrewd, funny and ever-readable book * <i><b>Guardian</b></i><b> Summer Reads</b> * Kynaston lingers on the cusp of two decades, delivering insights into the nation's mood as it eyed cultural, political, and commercial change * <b><i>Mail on Sunday</i> Summer Reads</b> * Epic series of post-war life ... Crams in such a mass of detail you feel you're living in "never had it so good" Britain * <b>Paul Routledge, <i>Tablet</i></b> * The latest volume in what is becoming the essential history of postwar Britain * <b><i>New Statesman</i></b> * David Kynaston is as much a poet as a historian of postwar Britain, and he has an accurate eye for the detail on which poetry depends ... No other writer evokes Britain's past so well * <b><i>Guardian</i></b> * He conveys 1950s life more vividly than any historian before him ... Masterful * <b><i>Economist</i></b> * David Kynaston's Modernity Britain so I can read about Terylene and Fray Bentos tinned steak and kidney pie under an alien sun * <b>Lucy Lethbridge, <i>Observer</i>, Summer Reads</b> * Praised by journalists to the skies ... A grand design ... David Kynaston tells the story in his own measured words ... Kynaston has researched widely into such sources and digests them into a readable totality. If this is, in part, a scissors-and-past project, it's also one that stands on its own feet ... This is not a novel. It is not a memoir, though it eats the memoirs of others, plankton fashion. It is a species of history - annals, perhaps. Kynaston's far from copious political judgements are sensible and considerate ... The book identifies a British modernity of snobbery and privilege, but acknowledges exceptions and cross-currents * <i><b>London Review of Books</b></i> * Kynaston's montage technique, which creates a palimpsest of private and public sources, is once again deployed to great effect in this, the fifth in a remarkable sequence of volumes that will eventually cover the period from 1945 to 1979 * <i><b>Standpoint</b></i> * This book is preceded by two two-volume books that have been praised by journalists to the skies ... David Kynaston tells the story in his own measured words, and he also tells it in the often loud and uninhibited words of others ... Kynaston has researched widely into such sources and digests them into a readable totality ... An affinity with the fiction of Antony Powell has been caught, but this is not a novel. It is not a memoir, though it eats the memoirs of others, plankton-fashion. It is a species of history - annals, perhaps. Kynaston's far from copious political judgements are sensible and considerate * <b>Karl Miller, <i>London Review of Books</i></b> * David Kynaston is a rare example of authorial effacement ... The sources - mainly letters and diaries - are left to speak for themselves. His work is suggestive rather than argumentative and one assumes that applying the word "modernity" to the country that Lawrence Durrell called "pudding island" is, at least in part, ironic ... Rather than writing from the Olympian vantage-point of the historian, Kynaston presents a succession of striking vignettes ... Kynaston is interested in the broad sweep of history * <i><b>Independent</b></i> * The latest instalment of his mammoth post-Second World War social history ... Skilfully blends highbrow with humdrum ... Kynaston has ranged widely in search of the spirit of the age, digging out local newspapers, youth-club records and Mass Observation survey results. All human life is here ... For those who recall Teddy Boys and the Angry Young Men, Sputnik, hula hoops and Nimble loaves spread with Blue Band margarine, Modernity Britain will be a swing-dance down memory lane. Readers born later in the century will, nevertheless, find themselves entranced by the narrative, which is as richly textured as a tufted carpet and hums with energy like a Hoovermatic twin-tub * <i><b>Country Life</b></i> * Kynaston's latest volume looks at how the luxuries of modernity - and its political bedfellows - swept the country in the late 1950s * <b><i>Independent</i>, Beach Reads</b> * There are in fact two David Kynastons. One is the relatively conventional historian who has given us solid and illuminating accounts of the City of London, the Bank of England, the Financial Times and much else. The other is the venturesome innovator engaged in cutting up the rich history of post-war Britain into quite thin slices, and retailing news stories and contemporary comments, often on a day-by-day basis, to give the vivid flashback into how things were, and were felt, at the time ... Applying his usual striking technique, Kynaston places such life-changing trends in the context of innumerable and contrasting contemporary incidents and comments, remind us of what people had on their minds ... What of Kynaston's grand project as a whole? The first part of Modernity Britain and its successor will see the story through to 1962 - the halfway mark in Kynaston's planned 32-year-long saga - so we may expect a final total of 12 volumes. Some have compared it to The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon, and it certainly has affinities with Anthony Powell's series of novels, A Dance to the Music of Time. In any case, we can look forward to more of a stimulating and refreshing achievement * <i><b>Times Higher Education Supplement</b></i> * David Kynaston's technique as a historian is subtly immersive. His magisterial Austerity Britain and Family Britain covered the years from 1945 to 1957. This one proceeds only to 1959, and the election that brought the young Margaret Thatcher to Parliament ... Kynaston's unobtrusive pen defers to the evidence he so painstakingly gathers, from newspapers and books, dairies and letters. The result is much more than a patchwork of period detail, but the detail is irresistible * <b><i>Intelligent Life</i></b> * Kynaston is engaged on a massive project with the overarching title Tales of a New Jerusalem, which aims to tell the story of Britain from the end of the Second World War to the election of Margaret Thatcher in an unspecified number of volumes * <i><b>Big Issue in Scotland</b></i> * Kynaston is engaged on a massive project ... Tales of a New Jerusalem, which aims to tell the story of Britain from the end of the Second World War * <b><i>Big Issue Cymru</i></b> * Most historians care to believe they are disinterested truth-tellers, pretending that they don't have a particular axe to grind. They like to shape history into a certain pattern, whether they are viewing it from the Left or the Right. Some favour heroes and villains, others a sense of inevitability in worldly matters. A few allow the reader the space and freedom in which to relish, where it is due, the mysterious ordinariness of the past. David Kynaston is of that rare number. His enthusiasm for the enduring importance of trivia is among his many virtues as a chronicler of British life in the postwar years. This riveting book is the fifth in the sequence Tales of a New Jerusalem. Like its predecessors, it assembles the great alongside the not-so-great, the talented next to the clueless. Churchill is still around, but it's Harold Macmillan who now hogs the political limelight ... One of the treasures the diligent David Kynaston has unearthed is the fact that Cliff Richard was once considered "dangerous" ... Kynaston's histories are wide in scope and at times lyrical in conception. I can't wait for the next instalment * <b>Paul Bailey, <i>Oldie</i></b> * When it is completed, Kynaston's multi-volume history of modern Britain will offer an unrivalled panoramic view of our country's social, cultural and political evolution between 1945 and 1979. This latest instalment focuses on the key years at the end of the 1950s when people were finally learning to turn their backs on austerity. His exhaustive trawl of sources, and his matchless gift for blending the trivial with the profound, ensure no corner of the national character is left unexplored * <b>Craig Brown, <i>Mail on Sunday</i> Books of the Year</b> * Modernity Britain ... is the latest episode of David Kynaston's profoundly humane history of 20th-Century Britain. His past is not another country inhabited by politicians and the famous. It is peopled by those whose lives are shaped, like ours, as much by food, music and weather as by wars and legislation * <i><b>New Statesman</b></i><b> ...</b></p><h2>Provocative Therapy</h2><p>Provocative Therapy will shock and provoke you as it challenges many traditional assumptions about the limits to be respected by professional communicatiors in the same provocative, earthy and humor-producing style that characterizes Provocative Therapy.<br>This book is a rich source of examples with extensive commentary as it chronicles the adventurous, warm and humorous journey undertaken by Farrelly in his highly successful quest for tools.

His now famous blog ('the bellwether American site that turned photo blogging into an art form' - "<i>New York Times</i>") was an attempt to showcase the wonderful and varied sartorial tastes of real people - not only those of the fashion industry. The book is a beautiful anthology of Scott's favourite shots from around the world. They include photographs of well-known fashion figures as well as those shots of the anonymous passerby whose imagination and taste delight the viewer. From the streets of Rio to Bejing, Stockholm to Milan, these are the people that have inspired Scott and in turn, inspired designers and people of all ages, wages and nationalities with an interest in fashion. Intimately designed and created with Scott, the book is a handsome object in its own right, in full colour on hand-picked, quality paper. --This text refers to the Paperback edition. <br><br> <p><strong>A Look Inside <i>The Sartorialist</i></strong> </p> <p> </p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> <p></p></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p></p> <br>About the Author Scott Schuman started The Sartorialist simply to share photos of people that he saw on the streets of New York that he thought looked great.

Week after week, Mauldin defied army censors, German artillery, and Patton&#x2019;s pledge to &#x201c;throw his ass in jail&#x201d; to deliver his wildly popular cartoon, &#x201c;Up Front,&#x201d; to the pages of <em>Stars and Stripes</em>. &#x201c;Up Front&#x201d; featured the wise-cracking Willie and Joe, whose stooped shoulders, mud-soaked uniforms, and pidgin of army slang and slum dialect bore eloquent witness to the world of combat and the men who lived&#x2015;and died&#x2015;in it. This taut, lushly illustrated biography&#x2015;the first of two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Bill Mauldin&#x2015;is illustrated with more than ninety classic Mauldin cartoons and rare photographs. It traces the improbable career and tumultuous private life of a charismatic genius who rose to fame on his motto: &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s big, hit it.&#x201d;</p><p>Todd DePastino is the author of Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America and Bill Mauldin: A Life Up Front, and the editor of the cartoon collections Willie &amp; Joe: The WWII Years and Willie &amp; Joe: Back Home. He teaches history and writes and lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Historian DePastino (<i>Citizen Hobo</i>) eloquently memorializes cartoonist Bill Mauldin, who won fame as the leading spokesman for the American combat soldier during World War II, in this authoritative biography. Mauldin (1921&#x2013;2003) grew up in Depression-era New Mexico in a dysfunctional family. After studying at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts for one year, he joined the newly mobilized 45th Infantry Division of the Arizona National Guard. Mauldin then became the <i>45th Division News</i>'s cartoonist. Deployed to North Africa in 1943, Mauldin participated in the invasions of Sicily and Italy. In 1944, while on staff at the GI newspaper <i>Stars and Stripes</i>, Mauldin created his signature characters, the weary and disheveled infantrymen Willie and Joe. Willie and Joe became soldiers' heroes and anathema to brass such as Gen. George Patton, who threatened to throw Mauldin in jail for his characters' indolence. After the war, Mauldin published bestselling cartoon collections, worked briefly as an actor, ran unsuccessfully for Congress and ended his career with two Pulitzer Prizes for editorial cartooning. Thoroughly researched and sprightly written, DePastino's balanced biography is a solid introduction to an American original. Classic Mauldin cartoons are an entertaining bonus. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Shoemaker&#x2019;s sportswriting has since struck a nerve with generations of wrestling fans who&#x2014;like him&#x2014;grew up worshipping a sport often derided as &#x201c;fake&#x201d; in the wider culture. To them, these professional wrestling superstars are not just heroes but an emotional outlet and the lens through which they learned to see the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Starting in the early 1900s and exploring the path of pro wrestling in America through the present day, <i>The Squared Circle </i>is the first book to acknowledge both the sport&#x2019;s broader significance and wrestling fans&#x2019; keen intellect and sense of irony. Divided into eras, each section offers a snapshot of the wrestling world, profiles some of the period&#x2019;s preeminent wrestlers, and the sport&#x2019;s influence on our broader culture. Through the brawling, bombast, and bloodletting, Shoemaker argues that pro wrestling can teach us about the nature of performance, audience, and, yes, art.<br>&nbsp;<br>Full of unknown history, humor, and self-deprecating reminiscence&#x2014;but also offering a compelling look at the sport&#x2019;s rightful place in pop culture&#x2014;<i>The Squared Circle </i>is the book that legions of wrestling fans have been waiting for. In it, Shoemaker teaches us to look past the spandex and body slams to see an art form that can explain the world.</p><p>David Shoemaker has been writing about wrestling since 2009. He is a former book editor and is currently a book designer at Henry Holt and Company. Shoemaker lives in Brooklyn.<p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>In modern professional wrestling, the really compelling shows start with what they call a &#x201c;cold open&#x201d;&#x2014;they skip the theme song, skip the formality, and get right to the meat. So let me try to do that here:</p><p>This is a book about dead wrestlers.</p><p>It was supposed to be, anyway. But along the way, it became a history of professional wrestling told through the stories of people who made the myths and who thereafter died. It&#x2019;s the story of a mythology populated not by gods but by real men, fallible mortals who served as vessels for a larger truth, men who lived the lives of kings and who suffered to be our idols. This is the ultimate fakery of wrestling&#x2014;that the emperor has no clothes, that the gods are mortals. But in reliving their lives, what became clear is that the mythology is what matters the most. We make our own gods for our own purposes. And we love them, and that&#x2019;s the whole point.</p><p>Dad took me to a wrestling show in 1987 at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky. Dad was no wrestling fan himself, but he knew how much it meant to me to see Hulk Hogan square off against the nefarious Killer Khan. My only concrete memory of the night was that the Hogan-Khan &#x201c;main event&#x201d; went on halfway through the card. When Hogan dispatched the Mongolian monster, I felt for a moment like it was time to leave; that was the main event, after all. It was a bit off-putting until my dad suggested that they must have done it that way because Hogan had a flight to catch. Even as a nine-year-old, I knew that this made sense, that there were perfectly good real-life situations that took precedence over wrestling &#x201c;reality&#x201d;; even as we were screaming along to the matches as we were supposed to, as the WWF matchmakers choreographed the night for us to, everybody in the arena knew this. Which is to say, we were in on the joke.</p><p>That&#x2019;s the first thing most people get wrong about wrestling fans. We can whoop for the good guys, hiss at the heel antics, and still know that the show is, well, a show. It was a year prior to that Hogan-Khan match when I was first awakened to the complexities of pro wrestling, when a group of good-guy wrestlers showed up in the WWF calling themselves the Machines. There were two of them at first: a burly, nondescript guy called Super Machine (I was too young at the time to recognize him as Bill Eadie, who would later go on to great fame as Ax of the tag team Demolition&#x2014;his moniker here was a play off of his previous gimmick as the Masked Superstar, a headliner in the Mid-Atlantic territory), and an enormous, stoop-necked monolith called Giant Machine. Even as a child I could see that Giant Machine was Andre the Giant.</p><p>Andre had been suspended earlier that year when he failed to show up for a match with two wrestlers from wicked manager Bobby &#x201c;The Brain&#x201d; Heenan&#x2019;s troupe. Now he was back, in disguise, and ready to resume his feud with the Heenan Family. As a kid, this was delicious comeuppance for Heenan, who had used every trick in the book to try to steer his wrestlers to victory over the good guys I idolized. Despite Heenan&#x2019;s loud insistence that Giant Machine was Andre, there was nothing the WWF officials could do, the mask being sacred territory in the wrestling world. (Almost every time a masked wrestler has wrestled, his opponents have tried to unmask him. That&#x2019;s the law of the jungle, though&#x2014;opposing wrestlers can prove their point by unmasking him in the course of a match, but that&#x2019;s the only way it will happen.) Eventually the Machines (and their manager, Captain Lou Albano) were joined by other teammates. First came Big Machine (who was really Blackjack Mulligan, but to me he was another generic behemoth), then later Animal Machine (indisputably George &#x201c;The Animal&#x201d; Steele), then Hulk Machine (Hulk Hogan, he of the most identifiable copper-tanned physique in the business), and later Piper Machine (who was so intent on being identified as &#x201c;Rowdy&#x201d; Roddy Piper that he was wearing a kilt). With every new partner, I cheered and laughed at the Heenan Family&#x2019;s misfortune.</p><p>Of course, the whole point was that we could see what Heenan could see, but nobody else&#x2014;not the announcers, not the referees, not the WWF front office&#x2014;could tell. The entire joke was that we were in on the joke.</p><p>My grandfather used to tell a story about a wrestling show in small-town North Carolina. A reporter from the local newspaper was assigned to cover the event, but he had someplace else to be on the night of the event, so he went by the arena the day of, watched the guys warming up, took some notes, and then asked the promoter who was going to win each match so that he could file his story ahead of time. He did. But, the story goes, there was a terrible storm that night, and the show was canceled. When the newspaper came out the next day with all the results listed, the townsfolk were infuriated and, in my grandfather&#x2019;s words, just about ran the reporter out of town with pitchforks and torches.</p><p>Note that the townsfolk didn&#x2019;t run the wrestlers out of town; they went after the journalist. They knew full well what the reality of wrestling was&#x2014;they were in on the joke. They just expected that the journalist would stay complicit in the enterprise. That a writer writing about wrestling would be a fan first and a critic second. Anyway, that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m coming from.</p><p>A quick note about &#x201c;facts.&#x201d; Not long after the Machines storyline, Andre turned to the dark side and was set against Hulk Hogan in a battle for the centuries. He beat Hogan on a dire episode of <i>The Main Event</i> that I watched with my whole family on my parents&#x2019; bed. I really have no idea why we were all watching; nobody else was a wrestling fan, and that was the only time it happened. But that night, with my parents and my sister bearing witness, the &#x201c;Million Dollar Man&#x201d; Ted DiBiase&#x2014;Andre&#x2019;s partner in crime&#x2014;stole the WWF title away from Hogan by furtively putting Earl Hebner in as the referee in place of his brother, Dave, who was the referee of record. The story goes that he paid for Earl to have plastic surgery to look just like Dave, so the two were indistinguishable except for their morals and motives. (In reality, the two were identical twins, and Earl&#x2014;himself a longtime WWF ref&#x2014;had only briefly been removed from television prior to the <i>Main Event</i> match in hope fans would forget about him.)</p><p>As a young fan, I was irate. The lesson, though, was the same as it had been with the Machines: Nothing in the world of pro wrestling is what it seems to be, and to assume that it is is to watch at your heart&#x2019;s own peril.</p><p>In researching this book, the main thing I realized about pro wrestling is that the offscreen world is almost as fantastical as the one on-screen. &#x201c;History&#x201d; is mostly quartered to the realm of wrestler reminiscence, which would be factually problematic on its own, but couple that with the industry&#x2019;s desire to mythologize everything and to keep up the facade of fakery that undergirds the sport and you end up with a lot of facts that contradict each other. What follows is my best effort to sift through them, organize them, break them down, and put them back together in something approaching truth. If all that follows isn&#x2019;t true in the plainest sense of the word, it&#x2019;s an honest effort at it. And at a minimum it&#x2019;s a look at reality through the distorted lens of pro wrestling unreality. It&#x2019;s the truth about a century of misdirection and lies.</p><p></p><p></p><p>(The world wants to be deceived, so let it be deceived.)</p><p>&#x2014;PETRONIUS</p><p>It&#x2019;s a life that leaves you lopsided.</p><p>&#x2014;LANSING MCCURLEY</p><p></p><p></p><p>THE</p><p> GOLDEN </p><p>ERA</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wrestling was a bastard art form from the start. You can trace its history back to &#x201c;catch wrestling,&#x201d;* a mutt form of organized grappling that incorporated aspects of Greco-Roman wrestling, Irish collar-and-elbow, Indian styles, and the famously violent brand of English fighting called Lancashire wrestling.* As the catch wrestling fad took hold in America, in New York and in traveling carnivals that toured the growing nation in the late nineteenth century, it continued to evolve with an increased emphasis on submission holds&#x2014;&#x201c;hooking,&#x201d; they called it&#x2014;as well as combative techniques from every corner of the country&#x2014;and every corner of the world, really, since masses of new immigrants populated the audiences.</p><p>Like all the other sideshow acts, these carnival wrestling acts were a fully interactive sham. Here&#x2019;s a description of the setup, recounted in 1935 in <i>Collier&#x2019;s</i>:</p><p>&#x201c;Easy money, boys,&#x201d; the barker shrills. &#x201c;Step up and get it, boys. You get a dollar for every minute you stay with one of these rasslers. You get a dollar, a clammo, a buckeroo, boys, for even one minute. You get fifty&#x2014;yes, fifty&#x2014;large dollars, boys&#x2014;if you can throw any of these wrestlers. Who&#x2019;ll try his strength and skill for fifty dollars, a half hundred&#x2014;enough to buy a plow, a horse or a winter coat for the little woman?&#x201d;</p><p>From the outskirts of the crowd a cabbage-eared, dough-nosed shill raises a hand and starts to elbow his way forward. The act calls for him to go up and throw one of the wrestlers, a maneuver calculated to give confidence to those who might want to try.</p><p>The wrestlers were mostly legitimate fighters, but the exhibition was imbued with shtick from the start for entertainment purposes. There are any number of stories of how the troupe would guard against defeat from particularly stout locals. It was one reason why wrestlers became well versed in hooking&#x2014;there&#x2019;s nothing like a nice toehold to bring a tough guy to his knees&#x2014;but more duplicitous means were also developed. The earliest days are full of legends about how the wrestler, when he began to feel overmatched, would wrangle his opponent back against the curtain abutting the back of the stage, whereupon an accomplice hidden behind it would clock the local through the curtain with a blackjack, unnoticed by the audience. The local guy would stagger to the ground, and the wrestler would pin him &#x201c;fairly.&#x201d; And on to the next contestant, and the next town.</p><p>The counterparts to the sideshow acts were the big-time matches that pitted top grapplers against one another, in large venues with larger crowds. This brand of &#x201c;professional wrestling,&#x201d; as it came to be known, was more or less <i>real</i>, although of course the outcomes of bouts were sometimes fixed&#x2014;which is to say that wrestling was real in those early days exactly to the extent that boxing was real. Wrestling and boxing existed in a sort of symbiosis for much of the twentieth century; oftentimes their respective popularity would rise and fall in inverse proportion. Wrestling was often the respite for disaffected boxing fans and vice versa, though over the decades the sports shared venues, management, and sometimes even athletes. So, yes, like boxing, wrestling started off as a legitimate sport. It just wasn&#x2019;t a very entertaining one.</p><p>Those early championship matches were frequently multihour slogs wherein the combatants rarely stood up off the mat or even moved enough for an audience member past the eighth row to notice. Sure, wrestling drew crowds, but it was not the sort of immersive spectacle that boxing was; it&#x2019;s true that in those days boxing bouts would often last hours as well, but if given the option, the average sports fan will choose the punch over the waist-lock ninety-nine times out of one hundred.</p><p>In the wrestling mainstream of those early days, though, even when one did not find rigged fights and predetermined endings, the industry was nonetheless marked by misdirection and mythology. Take the story of Frank Gotch, the sport&#x2019;s first iconic champion. It&#x2019;s said that in June 1899, a young Gotch agreed to wrestle a furniture salesman from the next town on a racetrack. Gotch lost, but as the fight dragged out to nearly two hours, it was clear that both men were grapplers of the highest order. As the furniture salesman left, he gave Gotch his card, revealing himself only then to be Dan McLeod, the Canadian-born American Heavyweight Champion of the wrestling world.*</p><p>The motif of gods and heroes coming to earth disguised as average peasants has a footing in Greek mythology&#x2014;see Zeus and Hermes taking shelter with Baucis and Philemon, Odysseus as the beggar, Odysseus as &#x201c;Noman,&#x201d; and so on&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s the central metaphor of the Christian faith today. When a historian encounters a scene such as the one told of Gotch above, his eyebrows instinctively rise. Even if there is historical reality to that racetrack match, the metaphorical reality&#x2014;the reason why the story persisted in popular memory&#x2014;is more significant: that Gotch was visited by a demigod in the rags of the masses who conveyed upon Gotch the imprimatur through which he himself would ascend to the level of the immortals.</p><p>The son of German immigrants settled in Iowa, Gotch was paradigmatic right out of the gate: Wrestling would be the sport of choice for all variety of new immigrants through much of the rest of the century, and Iowa would come to be a hotbed for collegiate wrestling to this day. That latter fact, it should be said, was largely due to the influence of Martin &#x201c;Farmer&#x201d; Burns, a world-famous wrestler* and himself an American champion, who founded wrestling schools in Omaha, Nebraska, and Rock Island, Illinois, and trained a generation of future grapplers, including Earl Caddock,* future game-changer Joseph &#x201c;Toots&#x201d; Mondt, and Rudy Dusek of the Dusek Riot Squad, a mob of four brothers that took over the wrestling scene in the Midwest and then New York City.</p><p>When Gotch defeated the &#x201c;Russian Lion&#x201d; George Hackenschmidt in Chicago&#x2019;s Dexter Park in 1908 in an epic two-hour battle, wrestling reached its first real national prominence. In most matches in those days, you had to beat your opponent in two out of three falls&#x2014;usually by &#x201c;tossing&#x201d; him to the mat after a lengthy period of grappling for dominant position&#x2014;but that day in Chicago, the first fall lasted two hours, and then it only ended because Hackenschmidt surrendered the fall; he didn&#x2019;t return to the ring thereafter, forfeiting the title to Gotch. Hackenschmidt is reported to have withdrawn graciously&#x2014;&#x201c;[Gotch] is the king of the class, the greatest man by far I ever met,&#x201d; he was quoted as saying in the American press&#x2014;but two days later, to the London <i>Daily Mail</i>, his story changed: &#x201c;The tactics by which I was defeated on American soil would not have been tolerated in England. Gotch&#x2019;s body was literally soaked in oil to prevent my holding him. All the world knows this to be unfair and against the rules of wrestling. He dug his nails into my face, tried to pull my ear off, and poke his thumb into my eye.&#x201d;*</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t necessarily an issue of Hack changing his mind; the discrepancy is as likely to be because one&#x2014;or both&#x2014;of the quotes was created by someone other than the Russian Lion. Such was sometimes the nature of the sports writing world in those days; wrestling immediately evinced itself as the perfect vessel for such fictional storylines. It&#x2019;s notable that both Gotch and Hackenschmidt were performers as much as they were fighters; Gotch appeared in stage plays over the years, and Hack was a vaudeville strongman. In their fight, they played the roles of opposing national heroes, and though the ending was not predetermined, it was left in such ...</p></p><h2>Victorian jewellery: A complete compendium of over four thousand pieces of jewellery</h2><p>This is a large hardbound edition w/ dust cover.

The great composer&#x2019;s subsequent sonata is originally dedicated to the young mulatto, but George, exuberant with acclaim, offends Beethoven over a woman. From this crucial encounter evolves a grandiose yet melancholy poetic tale.</p><p>Rita Dove is the recipient of many honors, including the Pulitzer Prize and the Fulbright Lifetime Achievement Medal. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, she is a Commonwealth Professor of English at the University of Virginia and lives in Charlottesville.This 12th collection from the former U.S. poet laureate and Pulitzer Prize recipient is her third book-length narrative poem: it follows the real career of the violin prodigy George Augustus Polgreen Bridgetower (1780&#x2013;1860), a former pupil of Haydn, as well as the grandson/ of an African prince, or so his promoters and teachers in England said. Moving to Vienna during the Napoleonic Wars, the violinist met and befriended the famously moody Beethoven, who was prepared to dedicate his famously difficult Kreutzer Sonata to Bridgetower until a rivalry for the same woman drove them apart. Dove tells Bridgetower's story, and some of Beethoven's and Haydn's, in a heterogenous profusion of short poems, some almost prosy, some glittering in their technique. In quatrains, a double villanelle, what looks like found text, short lines splayed all over a page and attractive description, Dove renders Bridgetower's frustrated genius: Music played for the soul is sheer pleasure;/ to play merely for pleasure is nothing/ but work. Dove does not always achieve such subtleties&#x2014;those who loved her early work may think this book too long: few, though, will doubt the seriousness of her effort, her interest at once in the history of classical music and the changing meanings of race. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Reunited for the summer, the Swallows and Amazons with Dick and Dorothea launch a prospecting expedition to find the lost gold mine of the high hills above the lake. But the mining camp runs into all sorts of trouble: not only the danger of fire in the drought ridden countryside but also scary encounters with unsafe tunnels.

The Dark Tower is soon to be a major motion picture starring Matthew McConaughey and Idris Elba, due in cinemas August 18, 2017.In the second novel of Stephen King&#39;s bestselling fantasy masterpiece, Roland of Gilead, the Last Gunslinger, encounters three mysterious doors which open - for Roland, and Roland alone - to different times in our world.</p><p>&#39;At the age of 19 Stephen decided he would like to write an epic similar to The Lord of the Rings. The &#39;spaghetti Westerns&#39; of that time [specifically The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] and a poem written by Robert Browning, &#39;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came&#39;, became the inspiration for his magnum opus.

This is the number of your fate.</p><p>Three?</p><p>Yes, three is mystic. Three stands at the heart of the mantra.</p><p>Which three?</p><p>The first is dark-haired. He stands on the brink of robbery and murder. A demon has infested him. The name of the demon is HEROIN.</p><p>Which demon is that? I know it not, even from nursery stories.</p><p>He tried to speak but his voice was gone, the voice of the oracle, Star-Slut, Whore of the Winds, both were gone; he saw a card fluttering down from nowhere to nowhere, turning and turning in the lazy dark. On it a baboon grinned from over the shoulder of a young man with dark hair; its disturbingly human fingers were buried so deeply in the young man's neck that their tips had disappeared in flesh. Looking more closely, the gunslinger saw the baboon held a whip in one of those clutching, strangling hands. The face of the ridden man seemed to writhe in wordless terror.</p><p>The Prisoner, the man in black (who had once been a man the gunslinger trusted, a man named Walter) whispered chummily. A trifle upsetting, isn't he? A trifle upsetting ... a trifle upsetting ... a trifle-</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>The gunslinger snapped awake, waving at something with his mutilated hand, sure that in a moment one of the monstrous shelled things from the Western Sea would drop on him, desperately enquiring in its foreign tongue as it pulled his face off his skull.</p><p>Instead a sea-bird, attracted by the glister of the morning sun on the buttons of his shirt, wheeled away with a frightened squawk.</p><p>Roland sat up.</p><p>His hand throbbed wretchedly, endlessly. His right foot did the same. Both fingers and toe continued to insist they were there. The bottom half of his shirt was gone; what was left resembled a ragged vest. He had used one piece to bind his hand, the other to bind his foot.</p><p>Go away, he told the absent parts of his body. You are ghosts now. Go away.</p><p>It helped a little. Not much, but a little. They were ghosts, all right, but lively ghosts.</p><p>The gunslinger ate jerky. His mouth wanted it little, his stomach less, but he insisted. When it was inside him, he felt a little stronger. There was not much left, though; he was nearly up against it.</p><p>Yet things needed to be done.</p><p>He rose unsteadily to his feet and looked about. Birds swooped and dived, but the world seemed to belong to only him and them. The monstrosities were gone. Perhaps they were nocturnal; perhaps tidal. At the moment it seemed to make no difference.</p><p>The sea was enormous, meeting the horizon at a misty blue point that was impossible to determine. For a long moment the gunslinger forgot his agony in its contemplation. He had never seen such a body of water. Had heard of it in children's stories, of course, had even been assured by his teachers-some, at least-that it existed-but to actually see it, this immensity, this amazement of water after years of arid land, was difficult to accept ... difficult to even see.</p><p>He looked at it for a long time, enrapt, making himself see it, temporarily forgetting his pain in wonder.</p><p>But it was morning, and there were still things to be done.</p><p>He felt for the jawbone in his back pocket, careful to lead with the palm of his right hand, not wanting the stubs of his fingers to encounter it if it was still there, changing that hand's ceaseless sobbing to screams.</p><p>It was.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Next.</p><p>He clumsily unbuckled his gunbelts and laid them on a sunny rock. He removed the guns, swung the chambers out, and removed the useless shells. He threw them away. A bird settled on the bright gleam tossed back by one of them, picked it up in its beak, then dropped it and flew away.</p><p>The guns themselves must be tended to, should have been tended to before this, but since no gun in this world or any other was more than a club without ammunition, he laid the gunbelts themselves over his lap before doing anything else and carefully ran his left hand over the leather.</p><p>Each of them was damp from buckle and clasp to the point where the belts would cross his hips; from that point they seemed dry. He carefully removed each shell from the dry portions of the belts. His right hand kept trying to do this job, insisted on forgetting its reduction in spite of the pain, and he found himself returning it to his knee again and again, like a dog too stupid or fractious to heel. In his distracted pain he came close to swatting it once or twice.</p><p>I see serious problems ahead, he thought again.</p><p>He put these shells, hopefully still good, in a pile that was dishearteningly small. Twenty. Of those, a few would almost certainly misfire. He could depend on none of them. He removed the rest and put them in another pile. Thirty-seven.</p><p>Well, you weren't heavy loaded, anyway, he thought, but he recognized the difference between fifty-seven live rounds and what might be twenty. Or ten. Or five. Or one. Or none.</p><p>He put the dubious shells in a second pile.</p><p>He still had his purse. That was one thing. He put it in his lap and then slowly disassembled his guns and performed the ritual of cleaning. By the time he was finished, two hours had passed and his pain was so intense his head reeled with it; conscious thought had become difficult. He wanted to sleep. He had never wanted that more in his life. But in the service of duty there was never any acceptable reason for denial.</p><p>"Cort," he said in a voice that he couldn't recognize, and laughed dryly.</p><p>Slowly, slowly, he reassembled his revolvers and loaded them with the shells he presumed to be dry. When the job was done, he held the one made for his left hand, cocked it ... and then slowly lowered the hammer again. He wanted to know, yes. Wanted to know if there would be a satisfying report when he squeezed the trigger or only another of those useless clicks. But a click would mean nothing, and a report would only reduce twenty to nineteen ... or nine ... or three ... or none.</p><p>He tore away another piece of his shirt, put the other shells-the ones which had been wetted-in it, and tied it, using his left hand and his teeth. He put them in his purse.</p><p>Sleep, his body demanded. Sleep, you must sleep, now, before dark, there's nothing left, you're used up- He tottered to his feet and looked up and down the deserted strand. It was the color of an undergarment which has gone a long time without washing, littered with sea-shells which had no color. Here and there large rocks protruded from the gross-grained sand, and these were covered with guano, the older layers the yellow of ancient teeth, the fresher splotches white.</p><p>The high-tide line was marked with drying kelp. He could see pieces of his right boot and his waterskins lying near that line. He thought it almost a miracle that the skins hadn't been washed out to sea by high-surging waves. Walking slowly, limping exquisitely, the gunslinger made his way to where they were. He picked up one of them and shook it by his ear. The other was empty. This one still had a little water left in it. Most would not have been able to tell the difference between the two, but the gunslinger knew each just as well as a mother knows which of her identical twins is which. He had been travelling with these waterskins for a long, long time. Water sloshed inside. That was good-a gift. Either the creature which had attacked him or any of the others could have torn this or the other open with one casual bite or slice of claw, but none had and the tide had spared it. Of the creature itself there was no sign, although the two of them had finished far above the tide-line. Perhaps other predators had taken it; perhaps its own kind had given it a burial at sea, as the elaphaunts, giant creatures of whom he had heard in childhood stories, were reputed to bury their own dead.</p><p>He lifted the waterskin with his left elbow, drank deeply, and felt some strength come back into him. The right boot was of course ruined ... but then he felt a spark of hope. The foot itself was intact-scarred but intact-and it might be possible to cut the other down to match it, to make something which would last at least awhile.... Faintness stole over him. He fought it but his knees unhinged and he sat down, stupidly biting his tongue.</p><p>You won't fall unconscious, he told himself grimly. Not here, not where another of those things can come back tonight and finish the job.</p><p>So he got to his feet and tied the empty skin about his waist, but he had only gone twenty yards back toward the place where he had left his guns and purse when he fell down again, half-fainting. He lay there awhile, one cheek pressed against the sand, the edge of a seashell biting against the edge of his jaw almost deep enough to draw blood. He managed to drink from the waterskin, and then he crawled back to the place where he had awakened. There was a Joshua tree twenty yards up the slope-it was stunted, but it would offer at least some shade.</p><p>To Roland the twenty yards looked like twenty miles.</p><p>Nonetheless, he laboriously pushed what remained of his possessions into that little puddle of shade. He lay there with his head in the grass, already fading toward what could be sleep or unconsciousness or death. He looked into the sky and tried to judge the time. Not noon, but the size of the puddle of shade in which he rested said noon was close. He held on a moment longer, turning his right arm over and bringing it close to his eyes, looking for the telltale red lines of infection, of some poison seeping steadily toward the middle of him.</p><p>The palm of his hand was a dull red. Not a good sign.</p><p>I jerk off left-handed, he thought, at least that's something.</p><p>Then darkness took him, and he slept for the next sixteen hours with the sound of the Western Sea pounding ceaselessly in his dreaming ears.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>When the gunslinger awoke again the sea was dark but there was faint light in the sky to the east. Morning was on its way. He sat up and waves of dizziness almost overcame him.</p><p>He bent his head and waited.</p><p>When the faintness had passed, he looked at his hand. It was infected, all right-a tell-tale red swelling that spread up the palm and to the wrist. It stopped there, but already he could see the faint beginnings of other red lines, which would lead eventually to his heart and kill him. He felt hot, feverish.</p><p>I need medicine, he thought. But there is no medicine here.</p><p>Had he come this far just to die, then? He would not. And if he were to die in spite of his determination, he would die on his way to the Tower.</p><p>How remarkable you are, gunslinger! the man in black tittered inside his head. How indomitable! How romantic in your stupid obsession!</p><p>"Fuck you," he croaked, and drank. Not much water left, either. There was a whole sea in front of him, for all the good it could do him; water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink. Never mind.</p><p>He buckled on his gunbelts, tied them-this was a process which took so long that before he was done the first faint light of dawn had brightened to the day's actual prologue-and then tried to stand up. He was not convinced he could do it until it was done.</p><p>Holding to the Joshua tree with his left hand, he scooped up the not-quite-empty waterskin with his right arm and slung it over his shoulder. Then his purse. When he straightened, the faintness washed over him again and he put his head down, waiting, willing.</p><p>The faintness passed.</p><p>Walking with the weaving, wavering steps of a man in the last stages of ambulatory drunkenness, the gunslinger made his way back down to the strand. He stood, looking at an ocean as dark as mulberry wine, and then took the last of his jerky from his purse. He ate half, and this time both mouth and stomach accepted a little more willingly. He turned and ate the other half as he watched the sun come up over the mountains where Jake had died-first seeming to catch on the cruel and treeless teeth of those peaks, then rising above them.</p><p>Roland held his face to the sun, closed his eyes, and smiled. He ate the rest of his jerky.</p><p>He thought: Very well. I am now a man with no food, with two less fingers and one less toe than I was born with; I am a gunslinger with shells which may not fire; I am sickening from a monster's bite and have no medicine; I have a day's water if I'm lucky; I may be able to walk perhaps a dozen miles if I press myself to the last extremity. I am, in short, a man on the edge of everything.</p><p>Which way should he walk? He had come from the east; he could not walk west without the powers of a saint or a savior. That left north and south.</p><p>North.</p><p>That was the answer his heart told. There was no question in it.</p><p>North.</p><p>The gunslinger began to walk.</p><p><b>4</b></p><p>He walked for three hours. He fell twice, and the second time he did not believe he would be able to get up again. Then a wave came toward him, close enough to make him remember his guns, and he was up before he knew it, standing on legs that quivered like stilts.</p><p>He thought he had managed about four miles in those three hours. Now the sun was growing hot, but not hot enough to explain the way his head pounded or the sweat pouring down his face; nor was the breeze from the sea strong enough to explain the sudden fits of shuddering which sometimes gripped him, making his body lump into gooseflesh and his teeth chatter.</p><p>Fever, gunslinger, the man in black tittered. What's left inside you has been touched afire.</p><p>The red lines of infection were more pronounced now; they had marched upward from his right wrist halfway to his elbow.</p><p>He made another mile and drained his waterbag dry. He tied it around his waist with the other. The landscape was monotonous and unpleasing. The sea to his right, the mountains to his left, the gray, shell-littered sand under the feet of his cut-down boots. The waves came and went. He looked for the lobstrosities and saw none. He walked out of nowhere toward nowhere, a man from another time who, it seemed, had reached a point of pointless ending.</p><p>Shortly before noon he fell again and knew he could not get up. This was the place, then. Here. This was the end, after all.</p><p>On his hands and knees, he raised his head like a groggy fighter ... and some distance ahead, perhaps a mile, perhaps three (it was difficult to judge distances along the unchanging reach of the strand with the fever working inside him, making his eyeballs pulse in and out), he saw something new. Something which stood upright on the beach.</p><p>What was it?</p><p>(three)</p><p>Didn't matter.</p><p>(three is the number of your fate)</p><p>The gunslinger managed to get to his feet again. He croaked something, some plea which only the circling seabirds heard (and how happy they would be to gobble my eyes from my head, he thought, how happy to have such a tasty bit!), and walked on, weaving more seriously now, leaving tracks behind him that were weird loops and swoops.</p><p>He kept his eyes on whatever it was that stood on the strand ahead. When his hair fell in his eyes he brushed it aside. It seemed to grow no closer. The sun reached the roof of the sky, where it seemed to remain far too long. Roland imagined he was in the d...</p></p><h2>Disney Animation : The Illusion of Life</h2><p>hardcover with dust jacket</p><p></p><h2>Modern Essentials Handbook: The Premier Introductory Guide to Essential Oils, (doTERRA Oils), 11th Edition, 2019</h2><p>Brand names for all d&#x14d;TERRA products are back in this go-to handbook, a complement to the Modern Essentials: The Complete Guide to the Therapeutic Use of Essential Oils.

In the wake of the 500th anniversary of Columbus's ``discovery'' of the New World, few historians are resisting the urge to attack the European exploitation of North America. Morgan (An Uncertain Hour, 1989, etc.) is no exception: For him, ``grand larceny'' might be more appropriate than ``settling'' to describe the European seizure of the continent. He emphasizes, for instance, French Jesuits' disruption of Indian culture rather than their zeal or physical courage. Morgan is short on analysis here, however, offering no real understanding of how the major American cities blossomed, or why North America, with all its problems, continued to attract settlers. He uses a variety of contemporary diaries, letters, and other documents to flesh out his story, which ranges from the Stone Age crossing of the Bering Land Bridge to the early 19th century. Morgan aims to write ``the story of mail carriers, sodbusters, circuit-riding judges, and Indian agents, of the people too busy occupying the land to make a claim on history.'' Although he veers a bit from his view from history's bottom rail (La Salle, the Virginian aristocrat William Byrd II, and Pilgrim governor William Bradford all receive excellent coverage), the author relates many an offbeat, sometimes jaunty, tale of ordinary people- -including Edward Marshall, whose marathon 60-mile walk in a day and a half helped William Penn's descendants swindle choice Pennsylvania land from the Indians; Eliza Lucas, who transformed the Carolinas' economy by introducing indigo; and Pop&#x160;, the outraged shaman who masterminded the 1680 Pueblo revolt--the only Indian rebellion that successfully expelled a colonial power. Not strong on the reasons for European settlement, but a vivid panorama that makes one look forward to Morgan's projected next volume in this saga. (Four maps) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this "collective biography of ordinary Americans," Morgan ( FDR ) offers an involving, if a bit disjointed, popular history of North America to the end of the 18th century. He draws on memoirs, journals and academic studies for his colloquial, panoramic narrative; his anecdotes mainly eschew the famous for intriguing characters like William Fitzhugh, who in 1674 built a 13-room house, complete with Turkish carpets, on Virginia's "gentrified" northern frontier. As Morgan covers the advances of the European powers and the formation of the United States, he does not ignore the many depredations of the powerful. But the French-born author is, above all, an American enthusiast, and he concludes by celebrating the emerging nation's egalitarianism and "spirit of enterprise." Sometimes, however, Morgan's search for relevance--as when he links colonial tobacco propaganda to 20th-century ads for "Marlboro Country"--seems strained, and he makes few attempts to apprise the reader of ongoing debates about historical interpretation.

I couldn&#39;t love anyone who didn&#39;t love this book.&#39; - Nigella Lawson When Diana Henry was sixteen she started a menu notebook (an exercise book carefully covered in wrapping paper) in which she wrote up the meals she wanted to cook. She kept this book for years. Putting a menu together is still her favourite part of cooking. Menus aren&#39;t just groups of dishes that have to work on a practical level (meals that cooks can manage), they also have to work as a succession of flavours. But what is perhaps most special about them is the way they can create very different moods - menus can take you places, from an afternoon at the seaside in Brittany to a sultry evening eating mezze in Istanbul. They are a way of visiting places you&#39;ve never seen, revisiting places you love and celebrating particular seasons. How to Eat a Peach contains many of Diana&#39;s favourite dishes in menus that will take you through the year and to different parts of the world.</p><p>Diana Henry is one of our best-loved food writers. She has a weekly column in the Sunday Telegraph and also writes for BBC Good Food, House &amp; Garden and Waitrose Weekend, as well as being a regular broadcaster on BBC Radio 4. Diana has won numerous awards for her journalism and books, including Cookery Journalist of the Year from the Guild of Food Writers (three times, most recently in 2015), Cookery Writer of the Year at the Fortnum &amp; Mason Food and Drink Awards in 2013 and 2015 and Cookery Book of the Year for Simple at Fortnum &amp; Mason Food and Drink Awards 2017. A Change of Appetite was voted Cookbook of the Year by the Guild of Food Writers in 2015 and A Bird in the Hand won a James Beard award in 2016. Diana has written ten other books including Crazy Water Pickled Lemons, A Bird in the Hand, Cook Simple, Salt Sugar Smoke, Roast Figs Sugar Snow, A Change of Appetite and Simple. Diana studied English Literature at the University of Oxford and journalism at City, University of London. She was a TV producer for the BBC for over ten years before starting to write.

His breaking of the German U-boat Enigma cipher in World War II ensured Allied-American control of the Atlantic. But Turing&#39;s vision went far beyond the desperate wartime struggle. Already in the 1930s he had defined the concept of the universal machine, which underpins the computer revolution. In 1945 he was a pioneer of electronic computer design. But Turing&#39;s true goal was the scientific understanding of the mind, brought out in the drama and wit of the famous &#34;Turing test&#34; for machine intelligence and in his prophecy for the twenty-first century.</p><p>Alan Turing died in 1954, but the themes of his life epitomize the turn of the millennium. A pure mathematician from a tradition that prided itself on its impracticality, Turing laid the foundations for modern computer science, writes Andrew Hodges:<p> </p><blockquote>Alan had proved that there was no "miraculous machine" that could solve all mathematical problems, but in the process he had discovered something almost equally miraculous, the idea of a universal machine that could take over the work of <i>any</i> machine.</blockquote><p> During World War II, Turing was the intellectual star of Bletchley Park, the secret British cryptography unit. His work cracking the German's Enigma machine code was, in many ways, the first triumph of computer science. And Turing died because his identity as a homosexual was incompatible with cold-war ideas of security, implemented with machines and remorseless logic: "It was his own invention, and it killed the goose that laid the golden eggs."</p><p> Andrew Hodges's remarkable insight weaves Turing's mathematical and computer work with his personal life to produce one of the best biographies of our time, and the basis of the Derek Jacobi movie <i>Breaking the Code</i>. Hodges has the mathematical knowledge to explain the intellectual significance of Turing's work, while never losing sight of the human and social picture: </p><p> </p><blockquote>In this sense his life belied his work, for it could not be contained by the discrete state machine. At every stage his life raised questions about the connection (or lack of it) between the mind and the body, thought and action, intelligence and operations, science and society, the individual and history.</blockquote><p> And Hodges admits what all biographers know, but few admit, about their subjects: "his inner code remains unbroken." Alan Turing is still an enigma. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><br> <p>"One of the finest scientific biographies I've ever read: authoritative, superbly researched, deeply sympathetic, and beautifully told."<b>--Sylvia Nasar, author of <i>A Beautiful Mind</i><br> </b><br> </p><br> <p>"A captivating, compassionate portrait of a first-rate scientist who gave so much to a world that in the end cruelly rejected him. Perceptive and absorbing, Andrew Hodges's book is scientific biography at its best."<b>--Paul Hoffman, author of T<i>he Man Who Loved Only Numbers</i><br> </b><br> </p><br> <p> "A remarkable and admirable biography."<b>--Simon Singh, author of <i>The Code Book and Fermat's Enigma</i><br> </b><br> </p><br> <p>"A first-rate presentation of the life of a first-rate scientific mind....

At first, Brunetti draws the obvious conclusion, that the corpse is that of a transvestite prostitute killed by one of his johns. When the victim is identified as the sober-sided director of the Banca di Verona, Brunetti realizes that he won't be taking his much-needed vacation after all. He turns up a link between the bank and the powerful Lega della Moralita, and when two people connected to the case die violently, Brunetti fears he may be the third but redoubles his efforts to uncover exactly what the Lega's goals are.<br>In Dressed for Death, Guido Brunetti faces his most potent foe yet, one with ties to the highest echelons of finance, the government, even the Church. While the tension mounts, we are treated to crystalline glimpses of Venice - at its best and worst - as seen through the singularly discerning gaze of Brunetti, devoted family man, bemused civil servant, and thoroughly irresistible sleuth.</p><p>Donna Leon teaches English at the University of Maryland Extension at a U.S. Air Force base near Venice, Italy.You're dressed for death when you're wearing a red dress, red pumps, and red lingerie--especially if you're Leonardo Mascari, director of the Venice branch of the Bank of Verona, fatally beaten in the Venetian suburb of Mestre. The evidence suggests that Mascari is a member of Venice's sad community of transvestite prostitutes, but Commissario Guido Brunetti (Death in a Strange Country, 1993, etc.) doesn't believe the evidence. After discovering Giancarlo Santomauro of the Lega della Moralit... in the apartment of a male prostitute who recognizes Mascari's picture but says he doesn't, Brunetti realizes he's up against something considerably more sordid than a sex killing. He's soon on the track of a simple and nasty scheme involving tax fraud and a protection racket on a heroic scale. But knowing isn't proving, and as the crooks begin eliminating each other, Brunetti, already battling political pressures in his office, wonders if he'll ever be able to make a convincing case against any of the honorable men who are left standing when the blood has cleared. One of the most appealing of recent detectives, Brunetti stars in a case that brings out his canniness and his compassion--and shows his creator spreading her wings more powerfully than ever. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Churchill. The book is a magnificent retelling of the American story, including some of the best short histories of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Revolutionary War and the Civil War ever written. The bulk of this book, America's history up to the twentieth century, has until now been found only within Churchill's much longer four-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1953. The chapters on America from that larger work have been knit together into a whole, and to them Winston S. Churchill has added essays and speeches of his grandfather's, many never before published in book form, to bring the book up to the mid-twentieth&nbsp;&nbsp; century.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Sir Winston Churchill's renown as a statesman has tended to overshadow his great gifts as a historian. History was the work of his heart's delight, and few subjects were dearer to him than America. His mother, Jennie Jerome, was American, and all of his life Churchill harbored a deep warmth of feeling for this country and a sense of its special destiny. With fondness, he called America "the Great Republic," and in his later years he trained all of his powers on the history this book contains. <b>The Great Republic</b> is stirring in its sweep and breathtaking in the flash and vigor of its insights. Only an author with Sir Winston Churchill's special perspective on America, his experience as a leader and strategist, his intimacy with the responsibilities of guiding a nation, and his great gifts as a narrative historian could have written a book that lays out America's history, character, and destiny with this book's special brilliance. <br><br>Statesman and historian Sir Winston Churchill led Great Britain through the Second World War as prime minister. He was the author of forty-two books, including the six-volume history The Second World War, which was chosen by the National Review as the nonfiction "book of the century."</p><p>Drawn from uncollected speeches and articles as well as from the author's four-volume <i>History of the English-Speaking Peoples</i>, this anthology of the great statesman Winston Churchill's writings on American history highlights both its author's vigorous prose style and his commitment to the idea that the United States and the United Kingdom shared not only a common past but a common destiny.<p> As a young man, writes his namesake and grandson in his introduction, Churchill toured some of the battlefields of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, and it is in writing of these two epochs and the expansionist years between them that Churchill is strongest. Of particular interest are his remarks on the ideological origins of the colonial revolution in such documents as the Magna Carta and the teachings of the Puritan elders, although, as an eminently practical politician, Churchill gives attention to less lofty causes of dissent--for instance, the English crown's logistical difficulty in governing an overseas empire with ideas of governance and resources of its own. Churchill's reflections on the Second World War are also of much value, and he provides an insider's view of the defeat of Nazism and the birth of the cold war.</p><p> Devotees of Churchill's work will not find much new here, but readers approaching him for the first time will find this volume to be a fine introduction to Churchill's writing and thought. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br>"In this absorbing volume, skillfully culled by his grandson from<p>Winston Churchill's vast literary output, the greatest Englishman of the twentieth century paints with surpassing elegance his</p><p>portrait of American history and the American character. This is</p><p>a good book to read--and a book to savor."<br>--Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.<br><br>"This excellent volume gives the gist of all Winston Churchill's writings and observations about American history. It is a wonderful read for Americans, and tells them a great deal about their country which many of them do not know and ought to know."<br>--Paul Johnson, author of <i>A History of the American People</i></p></p><h2>The Steel Remains</h2><p>A dark lord will rise.

Nancy Mitford's most famous novels, <b>The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate</b>, satirize British aristocracy in the twenties and thirties through the amorous adventures of the Radletts, an exuberantly unconventional family closely modelled on Mitford's own.<br><br>The Radletts of Alconleigh occupy the heights of genteel eccentricity, from terrifying Lord Alconleigh (who, like Mitford's father, used to hunt his children with bloodhounds when foxes were not available), to his gentle wife, Sadie, their wayward daughter Linda, and the other six lively Radlett children. Mitford's wickedly funny prose follows these characters through misguided marriages and dramatic love affairs, as the shadow of World War II begins to close in on their rapidly vanishing world.</p><p>Few aristocratic English families of the 20th century have enjoyed quite the delicious notoriety that the Mitford sisters courted in the years bracketed by two world wars. For a start, two of the girls, Unity and Diana, were Fascists (the former was a friend of Hitler and Goebbels, and the latter married Sir Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists). Two others took the writing route: Jessica ran away from home and became a famous muckraking journalist, and Nancy composed maliciously witty--and transparently autobiographical--novels as well as several biographies. <i>The Pursuit of Love</i> (1945), her greatest fictional success, and its companion, <i>Love in a Cold Climate</i> (1949), keep closely to the spirit (and details) of their youthful amusements and more grown-up adventures.<p> Seen through the adoring eyes of Fanny Logan, the self-effacing cousin who records their shenanigans with a wicked sincerity, the Radletts of Alconleigh shine with Gloucestershire glamour: apoplectic Uncle Matthew; Lord Alconleigh (modeled to a fine nuance after Mitford's father, Lord Redesdale, who like Uncle Matthew used to hunt his children with bloodhounds); his kind, rather vague wife, Aunt Sadie; as well as Fanny's favorite cousin Linda and the other six Radlett children. The Radlett daughters and Fanny wait impatiently for life to become interesting. Because of their station, however, nothing but marriage is expected of them, so they hurl themselves at love like crusaders, with varied and always fascinating results. At one point Fanny recounts: </p><blockquote> A few minutes only after Linda had left me to go back to London, Christian and the comrades, I had another caller. This time it was Lord Merlin...."This is a bad business," he said, abruptly, and without preamble, though I had not seen him for several years. "I'm just back from Rome, and what do I find--Linda and Christian Talbot. It's an extraordinary thing that I can't ever leave England without Linda getting herself mixed up with some thoroughly undesirable character. This is a disaster--how far has it gone? Can nothing be done?" </blockquote> <i>The Pursuit of Love</i> follows the romantic fortunes of Linda Radlett, while <i>Love in a Cold Climate</i> ventures further afield with the story of Polly Hampton's shocking love affair and its unexpectedly funny aftermath. Fanny's inexhaustible narration is a pleasant buffer for Mitford's deft teasing, which dances along just this side of mockery. The author of <i>U and Non-U</i>, a famous tongue-in-cheek treatise on the shibboleths of upper-class mores, Mitford often leaves the reader wondering just where she stands in the class wars, and much of her humor arises in the fine distinctions of aristocratic manners and speech. Still, there's an inimitable tart sweetness to these stories of true love and its pallid imitators, making them perfect snapshots of a vanished world. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i>Nancy Mitford (1904-1973) was born in London, the eldest of Lord Redesdale&#39;s seven children. By her twenties she was a friend of Evelyn Waugh and his circle and had begun writing novels.</p><h2>Growing Strong in the Seasons of Life</h2><p>This is the audio version of the one-year devotional by Charles Swindoll built around the seasons of life.</p><p>Charles R.

To compliment Muller&#39;s work for advocacy organizations such as WildAid and EarthEcho, the images are contextualized with essays from Philippe Cousteau, Jr. and marine biologist Alison Kock, who discuss exploration and conservation of our oceanic kingdom. Culture writer Arty Nelson adds an overview of Muller&#39;s work, while a technical section explains the precise equipment behind these spectacular shots. Together, these insightful texts and awesome images offer a record of breathtaking photographic feats, a tribute to the beauty and might of the shark, and a rallying cry for its fragile future.This book is also available in a signed Collector&#39;s Edition and two Art Editions, each including a signed and numbered print.</p><p></p><h2>Sketching Outdoors in Winter</h2><p>Provides drawings of landscapes, plants, animals, and other aspects of nature, accompanied by comments from the artist on how and why he drew them.</p><p></p><h2>Sons of the Oak (The Runelords, Book 5)</h2><p><br>Certain works of fantasy are immediately recognizable as monuments, towering above the rest of the category.

For until we are forced to stand alone, we never know the measure of strength that abides within us. And once a boy's father dies, he cannot be called a</i> child <i>any longer.</i>&nbsp;<br><i>--The Wizard Binnesman</i>&nbsp;<br>This was the face of the Earth King: Skin the shade of dark green oak leaves, fading in the fall. Old man's hair of silver webs. A sorrowful face as full of furrows as the rind of a rotting apple. And green-black eyes that were wild, hunted, like the eyes of a stag in the forest.That is how Fallion, at the age of nine, remembered his father. A father he had not seen now for three years.Strange then, that on an autumn evening as Fallion rode on a mountain track outside Castle Coorm with his younger brother Jaz and Hearthmaster Waggit beside him, and a small contingent of guards bristling front and back, the image of his father should intrude so heavily on Fallion's mind."Time to turn back," the point guard, a woman named Daymorra, said in a thick accent. "I smell evil."She nodded to her right, up a hill where fences of stacked gray stones parceled out some cowherd's lands and formed a dam that held back the leaning pine forests of the mountains above. There, at the edge of the forest rose a pair of barrows, houses for the dead. In the swiftly falling darkness, the shadows under the trees were black. And above the mountain hovered a haze, purple and green like a bruise in the sky. Strange lights flashed among the gauzy clouds, as if from distant lightning.Fallion's personal guard, Sir Borenson, laughed and said, "You don't smell <i>evil.</i> It's a <i>storm</i> you smell."Daymorra glanced back, troubled. She was a rugged woman from beyond Inkarra, with strange skin as gray as a tree trunk, black hair as fine as flax, and black eyes that glinted like lightning. She wore a simple outfit of ebony cotton covered by a supple leather vest, with an ornate steel buckler that covered her belly, and a slave's collar of silver around her neck. Neither Fallion nor anyone that he knew had ever seen anyone like Daymorra until she had shown up at the castle six months earlier, sent by Fallion's father to join the guard."Humans may not smell evil," Daymorra said. "But I've garnered endowments of scent from a burr. They know the smell of evil. Something is there, in trees. Evil spirits, I think."Fallion knew of men who had taken endowments of scent from dogs, but he had never even heard of a burr. Daymorra claimed to have taken endowments of hearing from bats, grace from hunting cats, and brawn from a wild boar. The skill to draw attributes from animals other than dogs was unheard of in Fallion's land. If her story was true, hers was an exotic amalgam of powers.Fallion rose up in his saddle, drew a deep breath, and tasted the air. It was so heavy with water, he could smell tomorrow's morning dew, and the air was just cool enough that he could feel the first thrill of winter in it.I do smell something, he thought. It was like an itch, an electric tingle, across the bridge of his cheek.Daymorra eyed the barrows distrustfully and shivered. "One should give dead to fire or water, not leave evil spirits in the ground. We should turn back now.""Not yet," Waggit argued. "We don't have far to go. There is a thing that the boys must see.Daymorra's nostrils flared; she reined in her horse, as if thinking, then urged it ahead.Fallion's younger brother Jaz had been watching the side of the road for small animals. Fallion's first vivid memory had been of discovering a frog--like a bit of gray-green clay with a dark mask. It had hopped over his head and landed on a lilac leaf when he was only two. He'd thought it was a "squishy grasshopper," and felt the most amazing sense of wonder. After that, Fallion and his brother had become obsessed with hunting for animals--whether they be hedgehogs in the fields above the castle, or batsin the guard towers, or eels and crayfish in the moat. Jaz spoke up, "What is a burr?"Daymorra frowned, then made big eyes and spoke as she rode. "A fawn, I think you call it. It is a forest fawn?"Jaz shrugged and looked to Fallion for help. Though Fallion was only a few months older than his brother, Jaz always looked to him for help. Fallion was both much larger than Jaz and more mature. But even Fallion had never heard of a "forest fawn."Waggit answered, "Among the islands where Daymorra's people come from, the burr is a small antelope--not much taller than a cat--that lives in the jungle. It is a timid creature. It is said that the burr can taste the thoughts of those that hunt them. The fact that Daymorra was able not only to catch one, but to take an endowment from it is ... remarkable."They rode around a bend in silence, plunged below a thin cloud, and climbed again, only the thud of iron-shod hooves and the slithering sound of ring mail announcing them. To the left, the dull sun floated on the horizon like a molten bubble in a vat of ore. For the moment there were clouds above him and below, and Fallion pretended that he was riding through the clouds. The road ahead was barren, riddled with rocks and roots.Fallion caught a movement out of the corner of his eye, glanced to his right, under the shadowed pines. A chill crept up his spine, and his senses came alive.Something was under the shadows. Perhaps it had just been a raven flitting under the trees, black against black. But Fallion saw Borenson reach down with his right hand and grasp his long-handled warhammer, whose metal head had a bird on it, with spikes sticking out like wings.Fallion was young enough to hope that a bear hid in the woods, or a huge stag. Something better than the ground squirrels and cottontail rabbits he'd been spotting along the road.They crested a small hill, overlooking a vale."Look there, my young princes," Waggit said soberly to both Fallion and Jaz. "Tell me what you see."A cottage squatted below, a tidy home with a freshly thatched roof, surrounded by ruby-colored roses and butterfly bushes. Birds flitted everywhere--yellow-headed bee eaters hovering and diving around the bushes.A woman was out late, handsome, in a burgundy work dress, her hair tied back with a lavender rag, raking hazelnuts onto a ground cloth while her red hens clucked and raced about pecking at bugs and worms in the freshly turned leaves.The woman glanced uphill at the riders, no doubt alerted by the thud of hooves on hard clay, the jangle of weapons. Worry showed in her eyes, but when she saw Borenson, she flashed a smile, gave a nod, and went back to work.Hearthmaster Waggit whispered to the boys, "What do you know of that woman?"Fallion tried to let his mind clear in the way that Waggit had taught him, to focus. He was supposed to gaze not just upon her face or figure, but upon the totality of her--her clothing, her movements, the house and possessions that she surrounded herself with.Waggit was teaching the boys to "read." Not to read characters or runes upon a parchment, but to read gestures and body language--to "read" people. Waggit, who had mastered several disciplines in the House of Understanding, insisted that "Of all the things I teach you, reading the human animal, as is taught in the Room of Eyes, is the skill that you will invoke most in life. Reading a person well can mean the difference between life and death.""She's not married," Jaz offered. "You can tell because she doesn't have any clothes but hers drying on the line." Jaz always tried to speak first, making the easy observations. That only made Fallion's job harder.Fallion was being tested; he struggled to find something more insightful to say. "I don't think she wants to get married ... ever."Behind him, Sir Borenson gave a sharp snort of a laugh and demanded, "Why would you say that?"Borenson knew this land, this woman. His snort sounded almost derisive, as if Fallion had guessed wrong. So Fallion checked himself, and answered. "You and Waggit are her age. If she wanted a husband, she'd smile and look for a reason to talk. But she's afraid of you. She keeps her shoulders turned away, like she's saying, 'Come near me, and I'll run.'"Borenson laughed again.Waggit asked, "Is he correct?""He's got the widow Huddard right," Borenson said. "Cool as midwinter.Many a man has wanted to warm her bed, but she'll have nothing to do with any of them.""Why not?" Waggit asked. But he didn't ask Borenson or Jaz. Instead he looked at Fallion, probing, testing.What he saw was a handsome boy with black hair, tanned features, nearly flawless. His face still swelled with the fat of a child, but his eyes held the wisdom of an old man.Waggit studied the boy and thought, He's so young--too young to plumb the depths of the human soul. He is, after all, only a child, without even a single endowment of wit to his name.But Waggit also knew that Fallion was of a special breed. The children born in the past few years--after the Great War--were different from children born in the past. Stronger. Wiser. Some thought that it had to do with the Earth King. As if the rise of the first Earth King in two millennia had bestowed a blessing upon their seed. It was said that children in the rising generation were more perfect than their forefathers, more like the Bright Ones of the netherworld than normal children.And if this was true of the get of common swineherds, it was doubly true of the Earth King's firstborn, Fallion.Fallion's brother Jaz was nothing like Fallion. He was a kind boy, small for his age, and already distracted by a salamander pawing through the dead leaves by the roadside. He would be a thoughtful prince someday, Waggit imagined, but nothing special.But Fallion had a greater destiny. Even now he gazed down upon the widow, trying to discover why she would never marry.Her little cottage at the edge of the wilds was so ... lush. The garden behind the house was lavish for a lone woman, and it was kept behind a tall fence so that her milk goat, which stood in the crook of a low apple tree, could not get the vegetables.Bushes and trees had been planted around the house to break the wind and offer shelter to birds--bee eaters and sparrows that, like the chickens, cleared the garden of worms and beetles.Wicker flower baskets hung from the eaves of the cottage, drawing honeybees, and Fallion did not doubt that the widow Huddard knew where the hives lay.This woman lived in harmony with nature. Her home was a little island paradise surrounded by rocky hills.Fallion said, "She works hard. Nobody around her works as hard. We've seen a hundred cottages along the road, but none like hers. She doesn't want to raise some man like he was a baby."Sir Borenson laughed again.Waggit agreed, "I suspect that you're right. The other shacks that we've passed were poor indeed. Their owners merely <i>survive.</i> They look at the hard clay, the rocky ground, and don't have the heart to work it. So they let their sheep and cattle crop the grass short and live off what scraps of meat they can get. But this woman, she <i>thrives</i> on ground that breaks the hearts of lesser men. One widow with the heart of a warlord, forever battling the rocks and clay and cold up on this hillside ... ." Waggit spoke with a note of finality. The lesson was done.Fallion asked Waggit, "Did you bring us all of the way up here, just to see one old lady?""I didn't bring you up here," Waggit said. "Your father did."Jaz's head snapped up. "You saw my da?" he asked eagerly. "When?""I didn't <i>see</i> him," Waggit said. "I heard the command last night, in my heart. A warning. He told me to bring you boys here."A warning? Fallion wondered. Somehow it surprised him that his father had spared him a thought. As far as Fallion knew, his father had forgotten that he even had a pair of sons. Fallion sometimes felt as fatherless as the by-blows that littered the inns down on Candler's Street.Fallion wondered if there was more that his father had wanted him to see. Fallion's father could use his Earth Powers to peer into the hearts of men and see their pasts, their desires. No man alive could know another person or judge their worth like Fallion's father.Fallion's horse ambled forward, nosed a clump of grass by the roadside. Fallion drew reins, but the beast fought him. "Get back," Fallion growled, pulling hard.Borenson warned the stallion, "Careful, friend, or the stable-master will have your walnuts."All right, Fallion thought, I've seen what my father wanted me to see. But why does he want me to see it now?Then Fallion had it. "With a lot of work, you can thrive in a hard place."With rising certainty he said, "That is what my father wants me to know. He is sending us to a hard place."Borenson and Waggit caught each other's eyes. A thrill passed between them."Damn," Borenson said, "that boy is perceptive."Movement up on the hill drew Fallion's eye--a shadow flitted like a raven between the trees.Fallion could not see what had drawn his attention. The wet trunks of the pines were as black as ruin. The forest looked as wild and rugged as Fallion's father.He focused on the tree line. A few great oaks sprawled silently along a ridge, offering shade to a pair of brown cattle, while smaller oaks crowded the folds. But still there was no sign of what had drawn his eye, and again Fallion felt uneasy.Something is there, Fallion realized. Something in the shadows of the trees, watching us--a wight perhaps. The ghost of a shepherd or a woodsman.The loud bleat of a sheep rode down from the woods above, echoing among the hills in the crisp evening air."Time to go," Borenson said, turning his horse; the others fell in line.But the image of the cottage lingered, and Fallion asked, "The widow Huddard, she ... makes a lot of her own things. She sells milk and vegetables, honey and whatnot?""And your question is?" Waggit asked."She lives well from her own labors. But I was born a lord. What can I make?"Fallion thought of the craftsmen at the castle--the armorers, the alewives, the master of the hounds, the dyers of wool. Each jealously guarded the secrets of his trade, and though Fallion suspected that he could master any of those trades, he had no one to teach him.Waggit smiled with satisfaction. "The common folk manipulate <i>things,</i>" he said. "Blacksmiths work metal, farmers till the land. That is how they earn their living. But a lord's art is a greater art: he manipulates <i>people.</i>""Then we are no better than leeches," Fallion said. "We just live off of others."Sir Borenson sounded so angry that his voice came out a near roar."A good lord earns his keep. He doesn't just <i>use</i> others, he empowers them. He encourages them. He makes them more than what they could become by themselves."Maybe, Fallion thought, but only because they know that he'll kill them if they don't do what he says.With a sly grin, Waggit added, "A lord's craft can indeed be marvelous. He <i>molds...</i></p><h2>Bluegill Fly Fishing &amp; Flies</h2><p>This paperback book "Bluegill Fly Fishing &amp; Flies" is in new condition. Copyright 1999 and this book is a 2nd printing.

Elizabeth has struck many observers as a lonely, aloof soul, struggling valiantly to hold a difficult family together while assuring her nation that the constitutional monarchy remains relevant in the modern world. </p><p> Over half a century of rule, Shawcross suggests, the queen has risen to every occasion and capably led both the British Commonwealth and the royal family, even if both have given her plenty of troubles in the bargain. This well-written and nicely illustrated portrait does a fine job of showing the many ways she has earned the affections, respect, and consent of her people. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>William Shawcross</b> is the author of major books of contemporary history, most recently <i>Deliver Us from Evil</i> and the classic <i>Sideshow.</i> In 1995, he presented a BBC series entitled <i>Monarchy.</i> He lives in London, England.</p><h2>Principle Centered Leadership</h2><p>The author invites business readers to center their professional lives around principles of excellence and quality and discusses the six conditions of effectiveness and the patterns of organizational excellence</p><p>The Eternal Drive for Excellence No matter what level of success we have achieved, none of us can be content to stay where we are. Within all of us lies an innate desire for progress in every aspect of our lives. In order to harness and utilize this internal drive in ourselves and those around us, we must learn to center our lives according to a set of certain basic principles Stephen R. Covey, author of the runaway bestseller <i>The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People</i>, tells us how to apply these principles to the problems we face every day---and how to meet the goals of all strong business leaders: quality, productivity, profitability, and win-win relationships. According to Covey, ineffective people try to manage their time around priorities, often losing sight of the fundamental character and skill development necessary for effective leadership. Here he draws on 25 years of consulting and teaching to provide new methods and practices that will improve our managerial, interpersonal and organizational lives.

You recognize his walk, the thunder of his voice.</p><p>He taunts you with bills you can't pay, people you can't please, habits you can't break, failures you can't forget, and a future you can't face. But just like David, you can face your giant, even if you aren't the strongest, the smartest, the best equipped, of the holiest.</p><p>David. You could read his story and wonder what God saw in him. His life has little to offer the unstained, straight-A saint. He fell as often as he stood, stumbled as often as he conquered. But for those who know the sound of Goliath, David gives this reminder:</p><p>Focus on giants -- you stumble; focus on God -- your giants tumble.</p><p>If you're ready to face your giants, let his story inspire you. The same God who helped him will help you.</p></p><p>More than 120 million readers have found comfort in the writings of Max Lucado. He ministers at the Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas, where he lives with his wife, Denalyn, and a sweet but misbehaving mutt, Andy.Megaseller Lucado, with 40 million books in print, will draw more readers to his fold with this newest release, which focuses on the life of the Old Testament hero David. David crashed onto the scene in ancient Israel when he used a slingshot and one stone to fell the giant Goliath. He went on to become Israel's greatest king. Now Lucado has modern readers slaying their own giants using principles gleaned from David's life. For example, David focused on God, not giants; David's life was threatened by his nemesis King Saul, but David worshiped God; David stole the beautiful Bathsheba from her husband and then had him killed, but God forgave. Lucado goes beyond the storytelling to offer readers concrete actions to help slay their giants using the metaphor of the five stones David chose in his Goliath quest. The stones represent the past, prayer, priority, passion and persistence. Lucado's lively language ("Focus on giants&#x2014;you stumble. Focus on God&#x2014;your giants tumble.") and casual style appeal to the most reluctant readers, yet his spiritual depth will challenge and amaze. Added value comes with the study guide keyed to each chapter. Lucado has a giant winner here. <i>(Nov. 21)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Instead, Campbell has skillfully crafted an intellectual, poetic, yet very readable thriller. Children's book writer Ben Sterling has returned to his boyhood home in the remote English country town of Stargrave. It was there that his grandfather, folklorist Edward Sterling, was found frozen to death and Ben's parents died under mysterious circumstances. Ben, now married with children, is drawn back to Stargrave by an ancient, alien lifeforce that takes possession of him as a gateway to control the world. Campbell expertly uses language to create a coiled, tense atmosphere and produce a chilling tale in the tradition of John Wyndom's Midwich Cuckoos (Ballantine, 1957; o.p.) or John Christopher's Possessors (S. &amp; S., 1964; o.p.) A welcome addition to any horror collection.<br><i>- John Larson, Fairfax County Pub . Lib . , VA</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."Trees grow," wrote the dying Edward Sterling in the frozen earth of the forest in Stargrave, England, that became his burial ground. As his grandson Ben learns, in Campbell's beautifully poetic horror novel, the elder Sterling was answering a call from a primordial species of snow that devours humans. Ben becomes a conduit for the gluttony of this creeping arctic cold, slowly losing his reason with each victim that the entity claims, as he succumbs to its promise of immortality in exchange for the lives of his neighbors. This icy menace can succeed only through manipulating Ben's consciousness, and he cooperates--until it hunts his family. Campbell's ( Ancient Images ) artful use of metaphor paints a frightening portrait of a world tilting into chaos and the price that must be paid to save it. This absorbing novel again demonstrates the author's mastery of the horror genre. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>21st Century Communication 1: Listening, Speaking and Critical Thinking (21st Century Communication: Listening, Speaking and Critical Thinking)</h2><p>21st Century Communication is a four-level series that uses powerful ideas from TED Talks to teach learners to think critically and communicate effectively.

Whether she&#x2019;s writing about date rape or political adultery or writers from John Updike to Gillian Flynn, Mary Gaitskill reads her subjects deftly and aphoristically and moves beyond them to locate the deep currents of longing, ambition, perversity, and loneliness in the American unconscious. She shows us the transcendentalism of the Talking Heads, the melancholy of Bj�rk, the playfulness of artist Laurel Nakadate. She celebrates the clownish grandiosity and the poetry of Norman Mailer&#x2019;s long career and maps the sociosexual cataclysm embodied by porn star Linda Lovelace. And in the deceptively titled &#x201c;Lost Cat,&#x201d; she explores how the most intimate relationships may be warped by power and race.&nbsp;<br><br>Witty, tender, beautiful, and unsettling, <i>Somebody with a Little Hammer </i>displays the same heat-seeking, revelatory understanding for which we value Gaitskill&#x2019;s fiction.</p><p><b>MARY GAITSKILL&nbsp;</b>is the author of the story collections <i>Bad Behavior, Because They Wanted To </i>(nominated for the PEN/Faulkner Award), and <i>Don&#x2019;t Cry, </i>and the novels <i>The Mare, Veronica </i>(nominated for the National Book Award), and <i>Two Girls, Fat and Thin</i>.

I was sixteen and staying in the apartment of a slightly older girl I&#x2019;d just met in a seedy community center in Detroit, where I was just passing through. I&#x2019;d been in her apartment for a few days when an older guy (he was probably in his mid-twenties) came over and asked us if we wanted to drop some acid. In those years, doing acid with strangers was consistent with my idea of a possible good time, so I shared a tab with them. When I started peaking, my hostess decided she had to go see her boyfriend, and there I was, alone with this guy, who, suddenly, was in my face. <br> &nbsp;<br> He seemed to be coming on to me, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure. LSD is a potent drug, and on it, my perception was just short of hallucinatory. On top of that, he was black and urban-poor, which meant that I, being very inexperienced and suburban-white, did not know how to read him the way I might have read another white kid from my own milieu. I tried to distract him with conversation, but it was hard, considering that I was having trouble with logical sentences, let alone repartee. During one long silence, I asked him what he was thinking. Avoiding my eyes, he replied, &#x201c;That if I wasn&#x2019;t such a nice guy, you could really be getting screwed.&#x201d; This sounded to me like a threat, albeit a low-key one. But instead of asking him to explain himself or leave, I changed the subject. Some moments later, when he put his hand on my leg, I let myself be drawn into sex because I could not face the idea that if I said no, things might get ugly. I don&#x2019;t think he had any idea of how unwilling I was&#x2014;the cultural unfamiliarity cut both ways&#x2014;and I suppose he may have thought that white girls just kind of lie there and don&#x2019;t do or say much. My bad time was made worse by his extreme gentleness; he was obviously trying very hard to turn me on, which, for reasons I didn&#x2019;t understand, broke my heart. Even as inexperienced as I was, I could see that he wanted a sweet time. <br> &nbsp;<br> For some time after, I described this event as &#x201c;the time I was raped.&#x201d; I knew when I said it that the description wasn&#x2019;t accurate, that I had not said no, and that I had not been physically forced. Yet it <i>felt</i> accurate to me. In spite of my ambiguous, even empathic feelings for my unchosen partner, unwanted sex on acid is a nightmare, and I did feel violated by the experience. At times I even elaborately lied about what had happened, grossly exaggerating the threatening words, adding violence&#x2014;not out of shame or guilt, but because the pumped-up version was more congruent with my feelings of violation than the confusing facts. Every now and then, in the middle of telling an exaggerated version of the story, I would remember the actual man and internally pause, uncertain why I was saying these things or why they felt true&#x2014; and then I would continue with the story. I am ashamed to admit this, because it is embarrassing and because it conforms to the worst stereotypes of white women. I am also afraid the admission could be taken as evidence that women lie &#x201c;to get revenge.&#x201d; My lies were told far from the event (I&#x2019;d left Detroit), and not for revenge, but in service of what I felt to be the metaphorical truth&#x2014;although what that truth was is not at all clear to me, then or even now.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> I remember my experience in Detroit, including the aftermath, every time I hear or read yet another discussion of what constitutes &#x201c;date rape.&#x201d; I remember it when yet another critic castigates &#x201c;victimism&#x201d; and complains that everyone imagines himself or herself to be a victim and that no one accepts responsibility anymore. I could imagine telling my story as a verification that rape occurs by subtle threat as well as by overt force. I could also imagine casting myself as one of those crybabies who want to feel like victims. Both stories would be true and not true. The complete truth is more complicated than most of the intellectuals who have written scolding essays on victimism seem willing to accept. I didn&#x2019;t even begin to understand my own story fully until I described it to an older woman many years later, as proof of the unreliability of feelings. &#x201c;Oh, I think your feelings were reliable,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;It sounds like you were raped. It sounds like you raped yourself.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t like her tone, but I immediately understood what she meant, that in failing to even try to speak up for myself, I had, in a sense, done violence to myself. <br> &nbsp;<br> I don&#x2019;t say this in a tone of self-recrimination. I was in a difficult situation: I was very young and unready to deal with such an intense culture clash of poverty and privilege, such contradictory levels of power and vulnerability, let alone ready to deal with it on drugs. But the difficult circumstances alone do not explain my inability to speak for myself. I was unable to effectively stand up for myself because I had never been taught how. <br> &nbsp;<br> When I was growing up in the sixties, I was taught by the adult world that good girls did not have sex outside marriage and bad girls did. This rule had clarity going for it, but little else; as it was presented to me, it allowed no room for what I actually might feel, what I might want or not want. Within the confines of this rule, I didn&#x2019;t count for much, and so I rejected it. Then came the less clear &#x201c;rules&#x201d; of cultural trend and peer example, which said that if you were cool, you wanted to have sex as much as possible with as many people as possible. This message was never stated as a rule, but, considering how absolutely it was woven into the social etiquette of the day (at least in the circles I care about), it may as well have been. It suited me better than the adult&#x2019;s rule&#x2014;it allowed me my sexuality at least&#x2014;but again it didn&#x2019;t take into account what I might actually want or not want. <br> &nbsp;<br> The encounter in Detroit, however, had nothing to do with being good or bad, cool or uncool. It was about someone wanting something I didn&#x2019;t want. Since I had only learned how to follow rules or social codes that were somehow more important than I was, I didn&#x2019;t know what to do in a situation where no rules obtained and that required me to speak up on my own behalf. I had never been taught that my behalf mattered. And so I felt helpless, even victimized, without really knowing why. <br> &nbsp;<br> My parents and my teachers believed that social rules existed to protect me and that adhering to these rules constituted social responsibility. Ironically, my parents did exactly what many commentators recommend as a remedy for victimism. They told me that they loved me and that I mattered a lot, but this was not the message I got from the way they conducted themselves in relation to authority and social convention&#x2014;which was not only that I didn&#x2019;t matter but that <i>they</i> didn&#x2019;t matter. In this, they were typical of other adults I knew, as well as of the culture around them. When I began to have trouble in school, both socially and academically, a counselor exhorted me to &#x201c;just play the game&#x201d;&#x2014; meaning to go along with everything from social policy to the adolescent pecking order&#x2014;regardless of what I thought of &#x201c;the game.&#x201d; My aunt, with whom I lived for a short while, actually burned my jeans and T-shirts because they violated what she understood to be the standards of decorum. A close friend of mine lived in a state of war with her father because of her hippie clothes and hair&#x2014;which were, of course, de rigueur among her peers. Upon discovering that she had been smoking pot, he had her institutionalized. <br> &nbsp;<br> Many middle-class people&#x2014;both men and women&#x2014;have learned to equate responsibility with obeying external rules. And when the rules no longer quite apply, they don&#x2019;t know what to do&#x2014;much like the enraged, gun-wielding protagonist of the movie <i>Falling Down</i>, played by Michael Douglas, who ends his ridiculous trajectory by helplessly declaring, &#x201c;I did everything they told me to.&#x201d; If I had been brought up to reach my own conclusions about which rules were congruent with my particular experience of the world, those rules would&#x2019;ve had more meaning for me. Instead, I was usually given a set of static pronouncements. For example, when I was thirteen, I was told by my mother that I couldn&#x2019;t wear a short skirt because &#x201c;nice girls don&#x2019;t wear short skirts above the knee.&#x201d; I countered, of course, by saying that my friend Patty wore skirts above the knee. &#x201c;Patty is not a nice girl,&#x201d; replied my mother. But Patty was nice. My mother is a very intelligent and sensitive person, but it didn&#x2019;t occur to her to define for me what she meant by &#x201c;nice&#x201d; and what &#x201c;nice&#x201d; had to do with skirt length, and how the two definitions might relate to what I had observed to be nice or not nice&#x2014;and then let me decide for myself. It&#x2019;s true that most thirteen-year-olds aren&#x2019;t interested in, or much capable of, philosophical discourse, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean that adults can&#x2019;t explain themselves more completely to children. Part of becoming responsible is learning how to make a choice about where you stand in respect to the social code and then holding yourself accountable for your choice. In contrast, many children who grew up in my milieu were given abstract absolutes that were placed before us as if our thoughts, feelings, and observations were irrelevant.</p><h2>Kitchen Princess 10</h2><p>HAPPILY EVER AFTER?<br><br>Najika heads to Paris for a major cooking competition, while things with Daichi fall apart and personal tragedy strikes again.

Whistler not only refused to tolerate misunderstanding by critics and the so-called art-loving public &#x2014; but launched vicious counterattacks as well. His celebrated passages-at-arms with Oscar Wilde and Swinburne, the terse and penetrating "letters to the editor," his rebuttals to attacks from critics, and biting marginal notes to contemptuous comments on his paintings and hostile reviews (which are also reprinted) are all part of this record of the artist's vendettas.<br>Whistler's most famous battle began when critic John Ruskin saw one of the artist's "Nocturnes" exhibited in Grosvenor Gallery. "I have seen, and heard," wrote Ruskin, "much of cockney impudence before now; but never expected to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face." Whistler was incensed with this criticism, and initiated the famous libel case "Whistler vs. Ruskin." Extracts from the resultant trial record are among the highlights of this book, with Whistler brilliantly annihilating his Philistine critics, but winning only a farthing in damages.<br><i>The Gentle Art,</i> designed by Whistler himself, is a highly entertaining account of personal revenges, but it is also an iconoclast's plea for a new and better attitude toward painting. As a historical document, it is the best statement of the new aesthetics versus the old guard academics, and it helped greatly in shaping the modern feeling toward art. <br></p></p><p></p><h2>The Irish Americans: A History</h2><p><p>Jay Dolan of Notre Dame University is one of America's most acclaimed scholars of immigration and ethnic history. In THE IRISH AMERICANS, he caps his decades of writing and teaching with this magisterial history of the Irish experience in the United States. Although more than 30 million Americans claim Irish ancestry, no other general account of Irish American history has been published since the 1960s. Dolan draws on his own original research and much other recent scholarship to weave an insightful, colorful narrative. He follows the Irish from their first arrival in the American colonies through the bleak days of the potato famine that brought millions of starving immigrants; the trials of ethnic prejudice and "No Irish Need Apply;" the rise of Irish political power and the heyday of Tammany politics; to the election of John F. Kennedy as president, a moment of triumph when an Irish American ascended to the highest office in the land. </p><p>Dolan evokes the ghastly ships crowded with men and women fleeing the potato blight; the vibrant life of Catholic parishes in cities like New York and Chicago; the world of machine politics, where ward bosses often held court in the local saloon. Rich in colorful detail, balanced in judgment, and the most comprehensive work of its kind yet published, THE AMERICAN IRISH is a lasting achievement by a master historian that will become a must-have volume for any American with an interest in the Irish-American heritage.</p></p><p>Jay P.

Indeed on publication it became the best available story of the Irish in America. He covers the poverty of the immigrants, their loyalty to one another, their struggles to create a place for themselves in this country against intense hostility and deep-seated prejudice, and their ultimate success despite all their enemies. The book explains why so many Americans who have an option to choose their own ethnic identity decide that they want to be Irish.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Andrew M.

Dolan explains how that process worked and why the story of Irish-America remains relevant at a time when we continue to argue about immigration and assimilation.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Terry Golway, author of The Irish in America</i></p><p>&#x201c;No matter how many times it is told, the story of these immigrants is awe-inspiring... Jay P. Dolan tells this familiar story with the care and consideration befitting someone holding the title of professor emeritus of history at the University of Notre Dame -- as Irish-American an institution as New York St. Patrick's Day Parade. Mr. Dolan is nothing like the Irish storyteller (seancha�) of old whose imagination, as Yeats wrote, is always "running off to T�r na n�g," the earthly paradise of Celtic mythology.

In this eloquent memoir, his friend and fellow desert rat Charles Bowden reflects on Abbey the man and the writer, offering up thought-provoking, contrarian views of the writing life, literary reputations, and the perverse need of critics to sum up &#x201c;what he really meant and whether any of it was truly up to snuff.&#x201d;</p><p><em>The Red Caddy</em> is the first literary biography of Abbey in a generation. Refusing to turn him into a desert guru, Bowden instead recalls the wild man in a red Cadillac convertible for whom liberty was life. He describes how <em>Desert Solitaire</em> paradoxically &#x201c;launched thousands of maniacs into the empty ground&#x201d; that Abbey wanted to protect, while sealing his literary reputation and overshadowing the novels that Abbey considered his best books. Bowden also skewers the cottage industry that has grown up around Abbey&#x2019;s writing, smoothing off its rougher (racist, sexist) edges while seeking &#x201c;anecdotes, little intimacies . . . pieces of the True Beer Can or True Old Pickup Truck.&#x201d; Asserting that the real essence of Abbey will always remain unknown and unknowable, <em>The Red Caddy</em> still catches gleams of &#x201c;the fire that from time to time causes a life to become a conflagration.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Author of many acclaimed books about the American Southwest and US-Mexico border issues, Charles Bowden (1945&#x2013;2014) was a contributing editor for GQ, Harper&#x2019;s, Esquire, and Mother Jones and also wrote for the New York Times Book Review, High Country News, and Aperture. His honors included a PEN First Amendment Award, Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction, and the Sidney Hillman Award for outstanding journalism that fosters social and economic justice. He wrote The Red Caddy in 1994."An unflinchingly honest writer addresses the death of his friend and kindred spirit Edward Abbey . . . Abbey lives within these pages, which Bowden wrote in 1994, shortly after the conference on Abbey. This belated publication should not only send readers back to Abbey, but also back to Bowden's work. A memoir about an American original by an American original, a literary journalist who merits more than a regional readership." (<i>Kirkus</i> 2018-02-06)<br><br>"Bowden, a journalist and author who died in 2014, knew Abbey better than most, perhaps, and attempts to paint a picture of the southwestern iconoclast in&nbsp;<i>The Red Caddy</i>. Discovered on his computer after his death, it's a fascinating artifact that's by turns charming and maddening &#x2014; just like Abbey himself." (<i>NPR</i> 2018-04-28)<br><br>"[Bowden and Abbey] were kindred spirits&#x2014;desert rats who wrote with&nbsp;beauty and power, and curmudgeons who tended to view our current state of humanity as spiraling the sink. Bowden looked up to Abbey, but&nbsp;he didn&#x2019;t let that get in the way of telling readers how his friend Abbey was, like all of us, a jumble of contradictions.&nbsp;The gruff anarchist had a delicate ego and he could be childlike in his spite. In Abbey&#x2019;s later years, the avowed environmentalist zoomed the desert in a gas-guzzling red Cadillac and saw little wrong with this pleasure. Bowden warns about turning the dead into saints, but he also can&#x2019;t deny that Abbey&#x2019;s spirit lives on." (<i>Outside</i> 2018-06-01)<br><br>"With its elegant prose and uncompromising vision, this is vintage Bowden." (<i>Arizona Daily Star, Southwest Books of the Year</i>)<br><br>"The mind of Bowden, and Abbey within it, make for a compelling source of vision and wisdom...honest, biting." (<i>Southwestern American Literature</i> 2019-01-01)</p><h2>Chipmunk Song</h2><p>A lyrical description of a chipmunk as it goes about its activities in late summer, prepares for winter, and settles in till spring.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 2 ``Imagine you are someone small sleeping on a bed of leaves in a cool, dark room underground.'' Taking this opening suggestion literally, just as young listeners might do, Cherry has turned Ryder's simple text about a chipmunk's late summer activities into an extraordinarily attractive picture book. The child that Ryder is addressing is shown on each double-page spread experiencing the same activities as the chipmunk. The miniature child and the animal itself climb into the sunlight, gather berries and nuts, hide from a hawk, prepare their snug burrows, and finally curl up for the long winter sleep. There is no interaction between child and chipmunk, subtly maintaining the distinction between what is real and what is imagined. The fine watercolor and ink illustrations, in cutaways below ground and at chipmunk eye-level above, are full of intriguing, accurate detail in a fresh perspective. Science, art, and imagination are rarely so well served. Janet D.

It turns out that thousands of people today are rediscovering the ancient practice of cat dancing, tapping into this remarkable method of channeling feline energy and bonding with their pets. Some whisper to horses; others dance with cats. Both are manifestations of humankind&#x2019;s continual striving to connect with their animal companions on a higher spiritual level. <i>Dancing with Cats </i>presents scores of delightful and inspiring photographs of people and cats engaging in their favorite routines, as well as moving testimonies of the personal transformations brought about through this uniquely joyous form of communion. A brave leap forward in the history of human-feline relations, <i>Dancing with Cats </i>gives people and cats reason to rejoice, jump up in the air...and dance!</p><p>With a hey diddle diddle, the creators of <i>Why Cats Paint</i> return with another version of feline (and human) reality. And suffice it to say that in Burton Silver and Heather Busch's hands, Kipling's cat that walked by himself has turned into a deeply codependent dervish. Their first book was a brilliant parody of artspeak--Busch's photos of creative felines matched by Silver's text. Their second, <i>Dancing with Cats</i>--an epic three years in the making!--juxtaposes psychological and spiritual mumbo-jumbo with the language of dance criticism. As Silver explores everything from visualization to mirroring to empathy, Busch is busy with her human-feline pairs. In one sequence, Fred, clad in tabby tights, kitty-cat body paint, and a tanga with a long black tail, leaps about the place with a slightly puzzled pussy: "I share its grace, power, and oneness with the universe. I relate to Fluff and the whole spectrum of feline physicality on a profound level--I even regard birds differently." <p> On the very next page, chubby Helen, sporting a tie-dyed purple gown and a deeply sworn belief in feng shui, identifies perhaps a bit too deeply with chunky, amber-eyed Boots (who looks suspiciously like "Trans-Expressionist" Bootsie from <i>Why Cats Paint</i>). And then there's Sue and Zoot. In one photo, the recumbent gray and peach cat raises his left paw to the sky as his ecstatic human does the same. Then Sue dons a feathery jerkin "in order to dance out some of her past traumas." It's difficult to say which is funnier, the photos or the text, as Silver catches pseudo-therapy's mixture of self-affirmation and non sequitur: "Dancing with Zoot helps Sue reenact and come to terms with the joy and sorrow of a brief but painful relationship: when she fell in love with her daughter's father while he was photographing bridges in the neighborhood." Though the two-legged models must have been prepared for this inspired silliness, one does wonder what on earth the cats made of their eurythmic adventures. Alas, until interspecies communication reaches a greater height, we can only dance amid our uncertainty! <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>While researching their groundbreaking book Why Cats Paint, Burton Silver and Heather Busch discovered another phenomenon that seemed to merit further investigation--people who dance with their cats. Or, more accurately, cats who dance with their people. All around the world today, people are rediscovering the ancient practice of cat dancing, tapping into this remarkable method of channeling feline energy. <p> Share the gift of feline grace, and connect with your cat on an entirely new level. Let yourself be inspired by the joyous photographs and moving testimonials in these pages. A brave leap forward in the history of human-feline relations, Dancing with Cats will have you and your cat jumping for joy--and cutting a rug--in no time.</p></p><h2>The Game of Life &amp; How to Play It</h2><p><b>This book will open your mind and renew your life!</b> <br> The late Florence Scovel Shinn, artist, metaphysician, and lecturer, left us with this beautiful and inspiring book brimming with precious brimming with the power of the word and the precions knowledge of the laws of perfect self-expression, and intuition.

To wit, copies of Daniel&#39;s books could be found in the library at Ghandi&#39;s ashram. This spirit lived on after his death, and the company maintained its niche by publishing definitive texts on a variety of spiritual and esoteric subjects. Many of these titles, notably those on Aromatherapy and Bach Flower remedies, have become standard works on the subject. When the C.W.

With painstaking scholarship and rigorous arguments, Mr. Smith examines, dissects, and refutes the myriad "proofs" offered by theists - the defenses of sophisticated, professional theologians, as well as the average religious layman. He explores the historical and psychological havoc wrought by religion in general - and concludes that religious belief cannot have any place in the life of modern, rational man.<br><br>"It is not my purpose to convert people to atheism . . . (but to) demonstrate that the belief in God is irrational to the point of absurdity. If a person wishes to continue believing in a god, that is his prerogative, but he can no longer excuse his belief in the name of reason and moral necessity."</p><p><b>George H.

Brick's depictions of Juan Cabrillo and his shipboard crew are diverse and easy to follow. His volume and pitch match the ever increasing tension as Cabrillo, hired by foreign interests to learn why top Russian specialists are dying, passes the information to the U.S. instead.

Surely it is just a legend? Then Sir Charles is found mysteriously dead in the grounds of Baskerville Hall. It is time to bring in Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson, to discover the truth about the family curse...<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br>Oxford Children's Classics bring together the most unforgettable stories ever told. Complete and unabridged text allows children to discover the stories as they were meant to be read. Produced in beautifully designed hardback editions, the collection features well-loved classic stories readers will treasure and return to again and again.</p><p>We owe 1902's <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher "Bobbles" Robinson, who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins, and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's "a real Creeper!" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. "The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul," Watson realizes. "Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths." Read on--but, reader, watch your step! <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>For generations the curse had hung over the Baskerville family. Now another life had been claimed by the mysterious and terrifying beast. Was it a demon or an animal lurking on the descolate moor?

From her comfortable home in Bielitz (present-day Bielsko) in Poland to her miraculous survival and her liberation by American troops--including the man who was to become her husband--in Volary, Czechoslovakia, in 1945, Gerda takes the reader on a terrifying journey. <br><br>Gerda's serene and idyllic childhood is shattered when Nazis march into Poland on September 3, 1939. Although the Weissmanns were permitted to live for a while in the basement of their home, they were eventually separated and sent to German labor camps. Over the next few years Gerda experienced the slow, inexorable stripping away of "all but her life." By the end of the war she had lost her parents, brother, home, possessions, and community; even the dear friends she made in the labor camps, with whom she had shared so many hardships, were dead. <br><br>Despite her horrifying experiences, Klein conveys great strength of spirit and faith in humanity. In the darkness of the camps, Gerda and her young friends manage to create a community of friendship and love. Although stripped of the essence of life, they were able to survive the barbarity of their captors. Gerda's beautifully written story gives an invaluable message to everyone. It introduces them to last century's terrible history of devastation and prejudice, yet offers them hope that the effects of hatred can be overcome. <br></p><p>Gerda Weissmann Klein was born in Bielsko, Poland, in 1924, and now lives in Arizona with her husband, Kurt Klein, who as a U.S. Army lieutenant liberated Weissmann on May 7, 1945. The author of five books, she has received many awards and honorary degrees and has lectured throughout the country for the past forty-five years. <i>One Survivor Remembers </i>(a production of Home Box Office and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum), winner of an Emmy Award and the Academy Award for documentary short subject, was based on <i>All But My Life. </i>She will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in early 2011.<br>All But My Life<br>Part OneChapter 1THERE IS A WATCH LYING ON THE GREEN CARPET OF THE LIVING room of my childhood. The hands seem to stand motionless at 9:10, freezing time when it happened. There would be a past only, the future uncertain, time had stopped for the present. Morning-9:10. That is all I am able to grasp. The hands of the watch are cruel. Slowly they blur into its face.I lift my eyes to the window. Everything looks unfamiliar, as in a dream. Several motorcycles roar down the street. The cyclists wear green-gray uniforms and I hear voices. First a few, and then many, shouting something that is impossible and unreal. "Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!" And the watch says 9:10. I did not know then that an invisible curtain had parted and that I walked on an unseen stage to play a part in a tragedy that was to last six years.It was September 3, 1939, Sunday morning. We had spent a sleepless night in the damp, chilly basement of our house while the shells and bombs fell. At one point in the evening when Papa, Mama, my brother Arthur, then nineteen, were huddled in bewildered silence, my cat Schmutzi began to meow outside in the garden and Arthur stepped outside to let her in. He had come back with a bullet hole in his trousers."A bullet?""There is shooting from the roofs, the Germans are coming!"Then, in the early gray of the morning we heard the loud rumbling of enemy tanks. Our troops were retreating from the border to Krakow, where they would make their stand. Their faces were haggard, drawn, and unshaven, and in their eyes there was panic and defeat. They had seen the enemy, had tried and failed. It had all happened so fast. Two daysbefore, on Friday morning, the first of September, the drone of a great many German planes had brought most of the people of our little town into the streets. The radio was blasting the news that the Germans had crossed our frontier at Cieszyn and that we were at war! Hastily, roadblocks had been erected. Hysteria swept over the people and large numbers left town that day.I had never seen Bielitz, my home town, frightened. It had always been so safe and secure. Nestled at the foot of the Beskide mountain range, the high peaks had seemed to shelter the gay, sparkling little town from intruders. Bielitz was charming and not without reason was it called "Little Vienna." Having been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire before 1919, it still retained the flavor of that era. Almost all of Bielitz' inhabitants were bilingual; Polish as well as German was spoken in the stores. In the center of the city, among carefully tended flower beds, stood its small but excellent theater, and next to it the Schloss, the castle of the Sulkowskys, the nobility closely linked to the Imperial Hapsburgs.Nothing in my lifetime had ever disturbed the tranquility of Bielitz. Only now, when I saw people deserting it, did I realize how close, dangerously close we were to the Czechoslovakian frontier; only twenty-odd miles separated us from Cieszyn.There had been talk of war for many weeks, of course, but since mid-August our family had been preoccupied with Papa's illness. Mama and I had been away in Krynica, a summer resort, from early June until the middle of August. Papa and Arthur had been unable to accompany us, and we returned when we received a telegram from Papa, suggesting we come home because of the gravity of the international situation. It had been somewhat of a shock to see how ill Papa looked when he met us at the station. His right arm was bothering him and Mama, alarmed, had called the doctor. The doctor diagnosed the illness as a mild heart attack and Papa was put to bed immediately.The following day two specialists were summoned to Papa's bedside. That same day we received a cable from Mama'sbrother Leo, who was in Turkey. It read: "Poland's last hour has come. Dangerous for Jews to remain. Your visas waiting at Warsaw embassy. Urge you to come immediately."Mama stuck the cable in her apron pocket, saying, "Papa is ill, that is our prime concern."Papa was to be spared excitement and worry at all costs, and visitors were cautioned not to mention the possibility of war to him. Mama little realized the fate we all might have been spared had she not concealed the truth from Papa. Yet on Friday morning, September 1, when German planes roared through the sky, Papa, who had been ill for two weeks, came face to face with reality. It was a tense day. I spent most of it in my parents' bedroom and instinctively stayed close to Papa.As that first day drew to a close, nobody touched supper, no one seemed to want to go to sleep. Mama sat in a chair near Papa's bed, Arthur and I watched from the window. Horses and wagons loaded with refugees continued to roll toward the East. Here and there a rocket, like blood spouting from the wounded earth, shot into the evening sky, bathing the valley in a grotesque red. I looked at my parents. Papa appeared strange, almost lifeless. The yellow flowers on Mama's black housecoat seemed to be burning. Outside, the mountain tops were ablaze for a moment, then they resounded with a thunderous blast that made the glass in the windows rattle like teeth in a skeleton's head. Everything was burning now. I looked at Mama again. Her soft, wavy, blue-black hair clung to her face. Her large, dark eyes seemed bottomless against her pale skin. Her mobile mouth was still and alien. The red glow was reflected in each of our faces. It made hers seem strange and unfamiliar. There was Mama, burning with the strange fire of destruction, and in the street the horses and wagons, the carts and bicycles were rolling toward the unknown. There was a man carrying a goat on his back, apparently the only possession he had. On the corner several mothers were clutching their infants to their breasts, and near them an old peasant woman crossed herself. It was as if the world had come to an end in that strange red light. Then, all of a sudden, Papa spoke to me."Go, call the family and find out what they are doing."I went downstairs. I sat down next to the phone with a long list of numbers. I started at the top and worked to the bottom, but there were no answers. The telephones kept ringing and ringing. I pictured the homes that I knew so well, and with each ring a familiar object or piece of furniture seemed to tumble to the floor.I became panicky. It seemed as though we were alone in a world of the dead. I went back upstairs. My parents and Arthur apparently had been talking. They stopped abruptly."Nobody answered, isn't that right?" Papa asked. I could not speak. I nodded. There was no longer any pretense. Papa motioned me to sit down on his bed. He embraced me with his left arm."Children," he said, "the time has come when I have to say what I hoped I would never have to say. I remember as if it were yesterday the cries of the wounded and the pale faces of the dead from the last war. I didn't think it possible that the world would come to this again. You believed I could always find a solution for everything. Yet I have failed you. I feel you children should go. Mama just told me that Mr. and Mrs. Ebersohn have asked to take you with them to look for refuge in the interior of Poland. I am sick when you most need my strength. I want you to go, children. I command you to go! His voice had assumed a tone of authority that I had never heard before. I saw Arthur look up startled at the mention of his girl friend's parents. More than ever he looked like Mama, but somehow he reminded me of Papa as he stood there tall, erect, and determined.Almost without hesitation, he said, "No! We are going to stay together."My parents' eyes met. I had a feeling there was relief and pride in their faces."I hoped you would say that," Papa said brokenly, "not for my sake, but because I hate to cast out my children to complete uncertainty. I believe that God will keep us together and under the roof of our house."He dropped back exhausted on his pillows. The effort hadbeen too much for him, and sudden stillness fell over the room. Strangely, all sound ceased outside as well and we noted that the sky was no longer red.&nbsp;<br>When I awoke the next morning everything was as peaceful as ever. The sun shone so brightly in my room. The fall flowers in our garden were in full bloom. The trees were laden with fruit. In my room everything was as it had always been, and what's more, even Papa was out of bed. His arm was in a sling, but he was up, and it seemed so wonderful I was sure the night before had all been a nightmare. No, not quite, because in my parents' faces I could read something that hadn't been there yesterday.When we met downstairs for breakfast everybody seemed cheerful. Papa was joking. Mama joined in this seemingly carefree banter. The maid had left to be with her relatives. Papa jokingly asked me whether I wanted the job. Nobody mentioned the war. I walked to the radio and turned it on. There was a sharp click, but no sound. I tried the phone, the lights, but all electricity was off. In a way that was good. There was no contact with the outside world. It was a wonderful, peaceful Saturday. But evening brought fury to the end of that last peaceful day. Sporadic shooting started from the rooftops, an attempt at delaying the enemy while our army retreated to Krakow. We looked for shelter in our cellar and sat there through the night. Toward morning the shooting stopped altogether and the vehicles of the Polish army ceased to roll. We came up from the cellar for a cup of tea in the living room. As I sat down on the couch near the window I could see the people outside in an obviously gay and festive mood, talking and laughing, carrying flowers, and everywhere the clicking of cameras."Mama, look," Arthur said. "Do you suppose-?" and he broke in the middle of the sentence, not daring to say what seemed impossible."No," Mama answered, and then Arthur pulled his watch out of his pocket, the roar of a motorcycle broke the stillness of our home, and his watch fell to the floor. It was 9:10 A.M.I looked out again. A swastika was flying from the house across the street. My God! They seemed prepared. All but us, they knew.A big truck filled with German soldiers was parked across the street. Our neighbors were serving them wine and cakes, and screaming as though drunk with joy, "Heil Hitler! Long live the F�hrer! We thank thee for our liberation!"I couldn't understand it. I didn't seem to be able to grasp the reality of what had happened. What are those people doing? The same people I had known all my life. They have betrayed us.The breakfast tea turned cold on the table. Papa and Mama looked down at the floor. Their faces were blank. Papa seemed so old, so gray. He had changed so much.I smelled something burning. A hot coal from the big green tile oven had fallen through the grill onto the carpet. I remembered a similar accident a year or two before and Mama had been terribly upset. Afterward she had turned the carpet so that the burned spot was under the couch. This time I wanted to shout a warning, but my throat froze when I saw my parents staring at that coal. They saw the carpet burn slowly, but they didn't seem to care. Finally, Papa got up and with his shoe carelessly shoved the coal back to the grill. Nobody spoke.I looked out the window and there was Trude, a girl I had known since childhood. She and her grandmother lived rent free in a two-room apartment in our basement in return for laundry service. Now I saw her carrying flowers from our garden, white roses of which we had been so proud because they bloomed out of season. She handed them to a soldier, breaking her tongue with the unfamiliar German, "Heil Hitler!" The soldier reached for the flowers, but somebody offered him some schnapps. He took the glass instead, the flowers tumbled to the dusty road, the boots of the soldiers trampled on them. I started sobbing, crying, releasing all my emotions and anxieties in that outburst. Arthur jumped over to me, put his hand over my mouth. "Are you crazy? Do you want to give us away?" But I did not hear him. The tears felt so good. He finally slapped me. "Think of Papa's life. Ifthey hear you crying-" I couldn't stop. He pulled me down from the couch, dragged me over the carpet, and up the stairs with Mama holding my mouth. They put me to bed, where I cried into the pillow until, exhausted, I fell asleep.Early in the afternoon the drunken, jubilant mob was still celebrating its "liberation" and hoarsely shouting "Heil Hitler." Papa and Mama smiled. Their smiles seemed more painful to me than my screams and tears, and I learned at that moment that I must not always cry when I wanted. I realized that we were outsiders, strangers in our own home, at the mercy of those who until then had been our friends. Although I was only fifteen I had a strong feeling, more instinct than reason, that our lives were no longer our own, but lay in the hands of a deadly enemy.Mama tried to maintain the pattern of our life, even on that fateful Sunday. She prepared dinner and we sat down as usual, but no one could eat and when the food was cleared away we sat in silence. Arthur got out books about the war of 1914 and looked up data about its development, but Papa said, "This is a different war. This one cannot possibly last four years. Four weeks, perhaps four months at most."Early in the evening, when the shouting of the drunken mob had died away, there was a knock at the door and a whispered, "Mrs. Weissmann." It was our neighbor Mrs. Bergmann, the mother of my friend Escia. She looked pale and shaken as she relayed the news that during the afternoon several Jews had been rounded up in the streets, locked in the Temple, and the Temple set on fire."Men had better stay out of sight," she whispered.Papa and Arthur exchanged glances. Mama's eyes widened and she pressed her lips together. But Mrs. Bergmann told us too that England and France had declared war on Germany that morning. She stayed only a few minutes. When she rose to leave, Mama saw her to the door and I followed them. Before they opened the door Mrs. Bergmann and Mama listened a while, then finally Mrs. Bergmann turned the knob and through a tiny opening glanced up and down the street before she slipped out.We sat a while longer in silence, none of us wanting to go to bed. That was the first evening in my life that I saw Mama without needlework in her hands. She just sat and stared into the fire. After a while she got up, outwardly calm and regal, and said, "Go to bed, children. We all will need rest and strength."Her words climaxed the first day under German rule.&nbsp;<br>The next morning, I was in the kitchen with Mama when Mrs. R�sche, one of the neighbors, came in with another woman and asked for our Polish flag."The flag?" Mama asked. "What for?""To make a German one, of course. It's really simple. You leave the red stripe as it is, cut a circle out of the white, and put a black swastika on it."Mama grew pale. At first she looked for our flag in places where she knew she wouldn't find it. Finally she brought it forth, knowing that she would have to sooner or later. Mrs. R�sche asked if Mama happened to have some black ribbon. She said she didn't. The other neighbor produced a piece. She told us it was good ribbon-that it would last for many years!Those two neighbors spent all morning sewing a Nazi flag to hang from our house....</p><h2>The Christmas Blessing (Christmas Hope Series #2)</h2><p><p>In <i>The Christmas Shoes</i>, young Nathan Andrews was a child who lost his mother to cancer.

A young mother grabbed her toddler and gave me a dirty look. I thumped the face of my watch, and the second hand seemed to groan before deciding to move. Too late now, I&#x2019;ll never make it, I thought, glancing at the clock in my dashboard. <br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t believe it; I was never late. I&#x2019;d noticed that my watch was having problems a couple days earlier and had been relying on an extra clock in my bathroom to make sure I was showered and out the door on time. As I was shaving I must have accidentally pulled out the cord just enough to stop the clock from running. The tires squealed as I pulled out onto the main road, and the gardener working at the entrance to the complex gave me my second nasty look of the morning, even shaking his head for effect. <br><br>If I made all the stoplights through town, I could get to the hospital in fifteen minutes. Turning into the hospital lot, I glanced at the clock-fourteen minutes-a new personal record. There was no time to circle for a spot, so I parked at the far end of the lot and ran for the main entrance. Maybe he hasn&#x2019;t started yet. Who was I kidding? Dr. Goetz never failed to start on time. I ran faster between the rows of cars. <br><br>As part of my third-year medical rotations, the university had placed me under the tutelage of Dr. Crawford Goetz-the best cardiologist in the hospital. Cardiology wasn&#x2019;t part of a normal rotation block, but the university felt that a rotation in cardiology would only enhance a student&#x2019;s studies. So, I was stuck for the next four weeks with Dr. Goetz. He was a Harvard and Vanderbilt man, the chief of cardiology, father of four, grandfather of two, and a thorn in my flesh. He specialized in pediatric cardiology, but since the hospital had only a small number of child patients a year, as department head, Dr. Goetz would also oversee the treatment of adult patients. <br><br>In each of our rotations, a medical student was part of a team that consisted of an attending physician, three to four students, and an upper-level resident. Peter Vashti was the upper-level resident on Dr. Goetz&#x2019;s team. My clipboard with the day&#x2019;s rounds was hanging at the nurses&#x2019; station, the last to be picked up. The other students and Peter were already following Dr. Goetz from room to room. I checked the room number for the first patient to be seen and ran to catch up, sneaking in behind William Radcliff, an old friend and fellow student who, to my good fortune, stood six-five. Dr. Goetz was sitting on the patient&#x2019;s bed, a forty-seven-year-old man recovering from open-heart surgery. <br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s working like a thirty-year-old&#x2019;s heart,&#x201c; Dr. Goetz said. <br><br>&#x201c;Does that translate to the rest of his body?&#x201d; the man&#x2019;s wife asked, cracking a wad of gum. Dr. Goetz laughed. He had a carefree, easy way with his patients and their families; too bad that didn&#x2019;t translate to his students. <br><br>&#x201c;So everything feels normal?&#x201d; Dr. Goetz asked, resting his hand on the patient&#x2019;s shoulder. <br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s cranky again,&#x201c; the wife said, her gum exploding like a firecracker. <br><br>&#x201c;Is that good or bad?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s good or bad, but for him it&#x2019;s normal,&#x201c; his wife continued. <br><br>The patient looked sheepish. Poor guy, no wonder he had heart surgery. She was relentless. <br><br>&#x201c;All right, Jason,&#x201c; Dr. Goetz said, smiling. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re ready to go home.&#x201d; The man shook Dr. Goetz&#x2019;s hand and I could see his eyes fill with tears; he started to speak, then stopped. He didn&#x2019;t want to get emotional in front of a handful of medical students. He pumped Dr. Goetz&#x2019;s hand again, nodded, and looked down at the sheet resting on his lap. Dr. Goetz squeezed his shoulder and turned to leave, nodding for us to follow. <br><br>Filing back into the hallway, we could hear Jason&#x2019;s wife get an early start on what could be heart attack number two. &#x201c;What do you mean you&#x2019;re not going to wear the piece? Just because your heart&#x2019;s working again doesn&#x2019;t mean your hair&#x2019;s going to grow back. Put this on. Put this on, or I&#x2019;m not walking out these doors with you, I mean it. I will not walk out these doors.&#x201d; For the sake of his heart, I hoped his head would shine like the new dawn as he left the hospital. <br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s our next patient,&#x201c; Dr. Goetz asked, scribbling something onto Jason&#x2019;s chart. &#x201c;Andrews?&#x201d; <br><br>I looked down at the chart in my hands. &#x201c;The patient in room 2201.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Andrews,&#x201c; he said, as if giving a speech to a room of five hundred. &#x201c;Just as you were not given a number at birth, but a name, you will find that your patients came into the world in the exact same manner. Learn who they are, not where they&#x2019;re located.&#x201d; <br><br>I could feel sweat break out on my upper lip. I never intended to seem demeaning toward the patient. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean it that...&#x201d; I began, but it was too late. Dr. Goetz had already learned the name of the patient and was leading the students through the halls. <br><br>&#x201c;And Mr. Andrews, as a reminder, your rotation begins at six A.M. Not six eighteen.&#x201d; I felt my chest tighten. I should have known that Dr. Goetz would pick up on my tardiness. <br><br>During a break in rounds, I retreated to the lounge and sank into the sofa. I leaned my head against the wall and rubbed my temples. If I&#x2019;d known there was going to be someone like Dr. Goetz in my future, I never would have signed up for medical school in the first place. I glanced at my watch and noticed it had stopped running again. I tapped the face, but the second hand wouldn&#x2019;t budge. I took the watch off and flipped it over to thump the battery casing. I ran my finger over the inscription: With all the love in the world, Mom. <br><br>My mother died about a year after she stood with me on the hill overlooking the valley. Maybe she knew she&#x2019;d never see me grow up; perhaps she was preparing me for the long valley I would go through without her, or maybe preparing her family and herself for death was the final step of faith she would take. <br><br>I remember my father coming into my room during the early morning hours of that Christmas. He said that my mother had stepped into Heaven. He let my sister Rachel sleep; she was much too young to understand what was happening anyway. I ran to the living room, where my mother lay still on the hospital bed; my grandmother was holding her hand, weeping. I watched my mother for the longest time, praying she&#x2019;d move again, that she&#x2019;d reach for me and say, You need to get back into bed, Little Man, but she couldn&#x2019;t reach for me, and I knew it. She was thirty-four years old. <br><br>Wilson&#x2019;s Department Store was about to close on that Christmas Eve as I ran from one department to the next looking for the perfect gift until the shoes caught my eye on a sales rack. I ran them to the front register and pulled a crumpled wad of bills and loose change out of my jeans pocket. When the clerk told me I didn&#x2019;t have enough money, I was heartbroken. I just had to buy those shoes for my mother. I turned to a man behind me, and, before I knew what was happening, he paid for the shoes, and I ran out the door for home. When I helped my mother unwrap the shoes, she held them to her chest and made me feel as if I&#x2019;d just handed her Heaven itself. We buried her in them. I started leaving shoes on her tombstone again when I was sixteen. The owner of Wilson&#x2019;s somehow found a similar pair every year and ordered them for me. <br><br>During the last weeks of her life, my mother wrote a series of letters to my sister Rachel and me. In one addressed to me she wrote, <br><br>Dear Nathan, I have had many joys in my life but none that have compared to you and Rachel. I always want you to know that I fell more in love with you every day. Please don&#x2019;t ever dread Christmas, Nathan, but remember to look for the miracles instead. It may be hard to see them at times but they will always be there because Christmas is the season for miracles. <br><br>She finished the letter and signed it, With all the love in the world, Mom. <br><br>I was helping my mother string lights on the shrubs outside our home the winter before she got sick when she first told me about the miracles of Christmas. &#x201c;Jesus was born at Christmas,&#x201c; she said, wrapping a long strand around a juniper yew. &#x201c;He left Heaven to live here.&#x201d; She bent over the back of the yew and tugged at the lights, stuck on a low branch. I pulled along with her, and together we continued wrapping the bush. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s kind of like us becoming a worm and living in the dirt,&#x201c; she said, wiping her nose. &#x201c;Love came down on Christmas, Nathan. That&#x2019;s the greatest miracle of all. That&#x2019;s the true blessing of Christmas and why it will always be the season for miracles.&#x201d; She stood back and admired her work, frowning at the tangled mess. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll look better when the lights are on.&#x201d; She dug into the box and pulled out another jumbled string, talking as she worked. &#x201c;If you get too busy, you won&#x2019;t see the miracles that are taking place right in front of you,&#x201c; she said, replacing a blown light. <br><br>Before she died, my mother bought special gifts for Rachel and me; she wanted my father to give them to us on our sixteenth birthdays. Rachel got a gold locket and I got this watch-a flat, gold-faced Timex with a simple black band. The inscription was a reminder of something I&#x2019;d always ...</p></p><h2>Other Powers: The Age of Suffrage, Spiritualism, and the Scandalous Victoria Woodhull</h2><p>From the author of Little Gloria . . . Happy at Last, a stunning combination of history and biography that interweaves the stories of some of the most important social, political, and religious figures of America's Victorian era with the courageous and notorious life of Victoria Woodhull, to tell the story of her astonishing rise and fall and rise again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>This is history at its most vivid, set amid the battle for woman suffrage, the Spiritualist movement that swept across the nation (10 million strong by midcentury) in the age of Radical Reconstruction following the Civil War, and the bitter fight that pitted black men against white women in the struggle to win the right to vote.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The cast includes:<br>Victoria Woodhull, billed as a clairvoyant and magnetic healer--a devotee and priestess of those "other powers" that were gaining acceptance across America--in her father's traveling medicine show . . . spiritual and financial advisor to Commodore Vanderbilt . . . the first woman to address a joint session of Congress, where--backed by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony--she presents an argument that women, as citizens, should have the right to vote . . . becoming the "high priestess" of free love in America (fiercely believing the then- heretical idea that women should have complete sexual equality with men) . . . making a run for the presidency of the United States against Horace Greeley and Ulysses S. Grant, and felled when her past career as a prostitute finally catches up with her.<br><br>Tennessee Claflin, sister of Victoria, also a clairvoyant, mistress to Commodore Vanderbilt . . . indicted for manslaughter in connection with the death of a woman in a bogus cancer clinic run by her father during the Civil War.<br><br>Henry Ward Beecher, the great preacher of Brooklyn's Plymouth Church--the most influential church in the country . . . brother of <br><br>Harriet Beecher Stowe . . . caught up in the scandal of the century (first revealed in Victoria Woodhull's own newspaper): his affair with Lib Tilton, the wife of his parishioner and best friend.<br><br>Lib Tilton, angelic, obedient wife of Theodore Tilton who believed her philandering husband's insistence that she was sexless and arid--until Henry Ward Beecher fell under her thrall and their affair exploded into the shocking Tilton-Beecher Scandal Trial that dominated the headlines for two years, made radical inroads toward the idea of acceptable sexual relations between men and women, and inspired the first questioning of the sanctity of the middle-class American Victorian home. <br><br>Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a discontented housewife who, bolstered by the great black activist Frederick Douglass, put forth a Declaration of Rights and Sentiments to empower women at the first woman's rights convention in Seneca Falls.<br><br>Anna Dickinson, lecturer extraordinaire, feminist heroine to thousands of women across the country, the model for Verena Tarrant in Henry James's The Bostonians.<br><br>Horace Greeley, editor of the Tribune, whose campaign for the presidency of the United States was centered on his opposition to the policies of Reconstruction . . . who helped to undermine the suffrage movement by writing editorials denouncing Victoria Woodhull.<br><br>Anthony Comstock, U.S. special postal agent, enthusiastically in charge of stamping out obscenity and pornography (he compared erotic feelings to "electrical wires connected to the inner dynamite of obscene thoughts"), who arrested Victoria Woodhull and Tennessee Claflin on charges of sending obscene material through the mail and was determined to bring his crusade against vice to the forefront of American thought, and to be hailed as a "paladin of American purity."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>All of these people play major roles in this compelling book. Barbara Goldsmith draws on ten years of research and letters, diaries, newspaper clippings, and court transcripts to tell the story of a woman who <br>embodied--and lived--the tumults that were shaping the America of her time.</p><p>In <i>Other Powers</i> Barbara Goldsmith takes a wide-ranging approach to the life of controversial feminist Victoria Woodhull (1838-1927). Goldsmith places her buccaneering subject within the context of 19th-century America's fascination with spiritualism, which enabled an accomplished medium like Woodhull to escape her impoverished origins and amass considerable wealth. Goldsmith also ably delineates the freewheeling Woodhull's uneasy relations with more respectable ladies in the women's suffrage movement and portrays the hatred of sexual hypocrisy that ultimately brought Woodhull's relentless enemies who wrecked her public career. History illuminates biography--and vice versa--in this boundary-defying work.Barbara Goldsmith, author of Little Gloria . . . Happy at Last and Johnson v.

In America alone, over 200 million people lack sufficient levels of vitamin D and may consequently suffer from chronic health conditions, ranging from daily annoyances like fatigue and pain to life-threatening illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. But few people know why vitamin D is so important and what they can do to avoid the myriad ailments associated with deficiency, including heart disease, cancer, and osteoporosis. <br><br> There is no better person to demystify this vitamin and showcase its place in human health than author Michael F. Holick, M.D., Ph.D.-the father of modern vitamin D research. With more than three decades spent studying the relationship between vitamin D, limited sun exposure, and human well-being, Dr. Holick shares his findings on how combining the natural curative properties of the sun along with small lifestyle changes can help everyone to live a substantially healthier life. <br><br> Armed with a three-step plan incorporating safe amounts of sun exposure, the right supplementation, and eating foods rich in vitamin D, Dr. Holick provides prescriptive advice for anyone- from relatively healthy people to those suffering from chronic or even fatal diseases- on how to easily rebuild and maintain optimal levels of this essential hormone. <br><br> Rich with anecdotes and entertaining case studies, <i>The Vitamin D Solution</i> also presents research from around the world to serve as a wake-up call on this potentially lifesaving hormone for health.</p><p>Michael F. Holick, ph.d., M.D., is the director of the General Clinical Research Unit and professor of medicine, physiology, and biophysics at Boston University Medical Center. He has been quoted in <i>The New York Times, Forbes, Time, Newsweek, Men&#x2019;s Health</i>, and <i>Scientific American</i>. He lives in Massachusetts with his family.<b><p>CHAPTER 1 <br>What Is Vitamin D? </p></b><p>Is it a hormone or a vitamin? </p> <p>Somewhere along the equator a ten-year-old girl is growing up with- out the luxuries most of us enjoy on a daily basis. She will never learn how to use a computer, order a pizza to be delivered, or drive a car to the mall for clothes and cosmetics. She spends most of her days playing outside near her farming parents, and soon she will join them in tilling the soil. She will never learn to read or write. She will endure periods of poor nutrition and poverty. And she knows nothing about sunblock and probably never will. </p><p>Now let&#x2019;s sail north to the United States or Europe, where another ten-year-old girl leads an immensely different life. She is maturing into a savvy user of electronics, passes the majority of her days indoors at a rigorous school, has access to the best nutrition and all the benefits that modern medicine can provide, and will know what <i>SPF </i> means long before graduating from high school and pursing higher education. </p><p>If both girls continue on their separate paths, the equatorial girl will be at least half as likely to get cancer during her lifetime as her northern counterpart. She also will have an 80 percent reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes in the first thirty years of her life. In fact, barring any freak accident or untreated medical condition, her longevity overall will be 7 percent <i>greater</i>. </p><p>The northern girl, on the other hand, faces a host of increased health risks throughout her life, from breast and ovarian cancer to depression, obesity, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, arthritis, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. She will be more susceptible to upper-respiratory-tract infections, dental cavities and gum disease, and infectious diseases like the flu and tuberculosis. As a group, she and her girlfriends will break their arms 56 percent more often than their peers did just forty years ago. Because she was born in northern latitudes and has lived there for the first ten years of her life, for the rest of her life she has a 100 percent increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis no matter where she chooses to live in the world after age ten. She would likely lose in a jumping contest with her equatorial sister, who can jump higher and with more force. If she complains of muscle weakness and wide- spread muscle and joint pain later on in adulthood, her doctor will likely diagnose fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome when tests don&#x2019;t turn up anything specific. The equatorial girl might never experience such debilitating aches or chronic pain and in fact may develop into a much stronger, leaner, and more fertile woman. If both women become pregnant, the equatorial mom-to-be won&#x2019;t have to worry as much about serious complications like preeclampsia. And she won&#x2019;t have trouble giving birth the old-fashioned way. The northern mom-to-be, however, will have a much higher risk of having an unplanned C-section and of giving birth to a child who will suffer from schizophrenia. </p><p>By the time the northern girl reaches midlife and her later years, chances are good that she&#x2019;ll have been treated for an internal cancer (breast, colon, ovarian, pancreatic&#x2014;take your pick) at some point and been prescribed multiple drugs to combat chronic ailments like hypertension, osteoporosis, arthritis, depression, obesity, type 2 diabetes, dementia, Alzheimer&#x2019;s, and perhaps even insomnia. Because of a significant loss of bone mass, she will be terrified of falling and fracturing a bone, and therefore will have limited some of her favorite outdoor activities, such as tennis, skiing, horseback riding, and golf, significantly cutting back on physical activity. And because she will have lost a considerable amount of muscle strength, her biological age will be much older than she really is. The equatorial woman not only may outlive her northern counterpart, but she&#x2019;ll also be less prone to chronic diseases that afflict her northern counterpart. For this reason, the equatorial woman may, overall, enjoy a higher quality of life&#x2014;even when advanced age sets in. </p><p>What&#x2019;s going on here? The answer lies in the difference between these two girls&#x2019; exposure to natural sunlight, which is our main source of vita- min D. Obviously, I&#x2019;ve taken some liberty in letting a few assumptions go. The equatorial girl&#x2019;s limited access to health care and preventative medicine has its own basket of risks, but let&#x2019;s focus for a moment just on the difference in exposure to sunlight and the conclusions that can be drawn from that single fact. Let&#x2019;s also assume that these girls grow up to exhibit vastly different levels of vitamin D in their systems, which is not a stretch given the documented records of vitamin D deficiency patterns across the globe. If I were to test each of these girls&#x2019; vitamin D levels, I would not be surprised to find the northern girl&#x2019;s levels terribly low as compared to her equatorial counterpart. And that difference means everything. </p><p>The sun is as vital to your health and well-being as food, shelter, water, and oxygen. I&#x2019;m going to prove it to you through a comprehensive exploration of vitamin D. What does vitamin D have to do with aging and disease? </p><p>More than we ever imagined. </p><br><b><p>Our Most Common Health Challenge </p></b><p>When I tell people that vitamin D deficiency is our most common health challenge globally, the response I get is pretty much the same in wealthy, developed nations: &#x201c;Well, that can&#x2019;t happen to me or anyone else in my country; besides, we have great health care.&#x201d; And when I remind people that the best way to ensure healthy levels of vitamin D is through sensible sun exposure two to three times a week, a common thread is heard in the response, which is along the lines of, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be serious. The sun is the demon of cancer and aging. No way am I going to consider sunlight as medicine. It&#x2019;s just not possible.&#x201d;</p> <p>The statistics proving otherwise speak volumes, and you&#x2019;re going to hear about them throughout this book. Increasing numbers of studies are confirming the link between vitamin D and optimal health, and attitudes are beginning to shift. Researchers have long known that the &#x201c;sunshine vitamin&#x201d; boosts bone strength by encouraging the body to absorb calcium, but only recently have we begun to see just how far- reaching vitamin D is in maintaining the health of every system and cell in the body&#x2019;s intricate machinery. Vitamin D may be as vital to your heart and brain health, for example, as it is to your bone health. As noted in the introduction, increasing the amount of vitamin D in the body can prevent or help treat a remarkable number of ailments, from high blood pressure to back pain, from diabetes to arthritis, from upper-respiratory- tract infections to infectious diseases, and from fibromyalgia to cancer. It also seems to improve fertility, weight control, and memory. </p><p>The evidence is clear: just as we require a little fat and salt for survival, we need the sun in moderation, too. I&#x2019;ll add to that the following fact, which will be fully explored in chapter 8: there is essentially no substantiated scientific evidence to suggest that moderate sun exposure significantly increases risks of benign skin cancers or, and more importantly, the most deadly form of skin cancer, melanoma. In fact, if you were unfortunately to develop melanoma, you would be more likely to survive it if you had adequate sun exposure as a child and young adult. And if you had adequate sun exposure as a child, you would have a 40 percent reduced risk of developing lymphoma as a young adult. </p><p>In the past five years alone there has been a breakthrough in our understanding of why sun exposure benefits health in so many ways, something that was not fully comprehended until now. This breakthrough has forced people to take a closer look at the value of sun exposure. I am proud to say that I have been at the forefront of this research. </p><p>Groundbreaking new research has linked a wide array of disorders that afflict up to two hundred million Americans to a single common factor&#x2014;vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, the most common medical condition in the world with sometimes devastating, if not fatal, consequences. </p><p>And the research keeps coming from various labs around the world investigating vitamin D. As I write this, doctors at the University of Pennsylvania have revealed that vitamin D can prevent or forestall the irreversible decline in respiratory function over time that leaves many asthmatics even more vulnerable when they suffer an asthma attack. At the same time, scientists at the Moores Cancer Center at the University of California at San Diego have raised the possibility that low vitamin D may be the root cause of cancer. No doubt we will continue to see remarkable studies emerge, and you&#x2019;ll be reading about some of the more fascinating and profound studies in the upcoming chapters. It&#x2019;s no wonder that this vitamin made <i>Time </i> magazine&#x2019;s list of the top ten medical breakthroughs of 2007. So if you can dramatically decrease your risk of illness and age-related disease and live a healthier, happier life&#x2014; without its costing you a penny&#x2014;wouldn&#x2019;t you want to do that? </p><br><b><p>Centuries of Problem Solving </p></b><p>When you put the vitamin D story into the perspective of human history, it begins with the Industrial Revolution. As the revolution began to sweep across northern Europe in the mid-seventeenth century, doctors reported seeing a new disease that afflicted young children with a constellation of physical signs and symptoms, notably deformities of the skeleton, such as bowed legs, misshapen pelvis, enlarged head, prominent knobby projections along the ribs, curvature of the spine, poor teeth, and weak and flabby legs. The disease had devastating consequences. It not only retarded growth and carried serious risk of upper- respiratory-tract infections including tuberculosis and influenza, but it also had far-reaching effects into adulthood and impaired these children&#x2019;s ability to function throughout their lives. Women with a distorted pelvis often had difficulty with childbirth and were at high risk of dying or giving birth to an unhealthy child. </p><p>Several theories about the cause of this debilitating disease called rickets surfaced in the early 1900s, including infection, lack of activity, poor nutrition, and an inherited disorder. Although cod liver oil (high in vitamin D) appeared to be effective in preventing the disease, it was principally used on the coastlines of the Scandinavian countries and the United Kingdom and was not widely used elsewhere. The disease continued to plague the industrial centers of the world. </p><p>What was happening was that as people began to congregate in Great Britain and northern Europe, they erected cities whose tightly placed buildings closed off to sunlight the alleys where kids were hanging out and living. Compounding the problem was the gathering pollution from coal burning, which thickened the air and blocked the sun&#x2019;s rays. When these kids started to show signs of bone deformities, doctors began to take note. </p><br><b><p>&#x201c;Water works wonders, air can do even more, but light works best of all.&#x201d; </p></b><p>In the 1820s, a Polish doctor named Jedrzej Sniadecki observed that children who lived in the city of Warsaw had a much higher prevalence of rickets than youngsters who lived in the Polish countryside. Dr. Sniadecki thought it was probably the lack of sunshine in the cramped confines of Warsaw that was to blame for this widespread condition. He was able to successfully treat the afflicted city kids by taking them into the country- side for sun exposure. But he wasn&#x2019;t taken seriously. It was inconceivable to the scientific community at the time that exposure of skin to sunlight could have any impact on the skeleton. Indeed, it would take another seventy years before the British Medical Association in 1889 reported that rickets was rarely seen in the rural districts of the British Isles but was prevalent in large industrialized towns, suggesting that lack of sun exposure was responsible for the high incidence of rickets. </p> <p>A year later, a British doctor collected clinical observations from a number of his colleagues throughout the British Empire and the Orient and found that rickets abounded in the industrialized centers of Great Britain, whereas the impoverished cities of China, Japan, and India, where people lived in squalor and had poor nutrition, were spared from this bone-deforming disease. But like Dr. Sniadecki, this early visionary&#x2019;s findings weren&#x2019;t taken seriously. Although the exact relationship between sunlight and bone development was not yet understood, a health movement was pioneered by Arnold Rikli at the end of the 1800s with this motto: &#x201c;Water works wonders, air can do even more, but [sun] light works best of all.&#x201d; </p><p>It was difficult for the scientific community to embrace the concept that the simple remedy of exposure to sunlight could cure this bone-de- forming disease, and little was done to use these insightful observations for the prevention and cure of rickets. When scientists began investigating the connection between sunlight and health, it was initially believed that the warmth generated by the sun conferred the health benefits. It was Sir Eve- rard Home, who, in the late 1700s and early 1800s, deduced that it wasn&#x2019;t the heat of the sun&#x2019;s radiation but rather the occurrence of a chemical effect on the body caused by the sun that produced sunburn. Home also showed that dark-skinned people had a natural resistance to sunburn. </p><p>By 1900, it was estimated that 80 percent of the children living in the industrialized cities of northern Europe and the northeastern United States were afflicted with rickets. Almost one hundred years after Dr. Sniadecki&#x2019;s first report, a German physician by the name of Kurt Huldschinsky reported that exposure to ultraviolet radiation from a mercury arc lamp was an effective method of curing patients with severe rickets. He cleverly demonstrated that the effect of phototherapy was not a direct effect on the skeleton, inasmuch as exposure of one arm had an equal and dramatic effect on the cure of rickets in both arms. People thought he was nuts for irradiating sick kids with a mercury arc lamp (mind you, this was long before skin cancer became part of the conversation), but some took his idea to heart. Two years later, in 1921, two New York doctors (Hess and Unger) exposed eight children suffering from rickets to sunlight on the rooftop of a New York City hospital. They showed through X-ray examination marked improvement in each child. Finally, the scientific community was ready to listen. </p><p>In the early 1930s, the U.S. government set up an agency that recom- mended to parents that they put their children outside for a reasonable amount of sun exposure. Several manufacturers also began to produce ultraviolet (UV) lamps that were then sold in local pharmacies through- out the 1930s, &#x2019;40s, and &#x2019;50s. I know, difficult to believe given today&#x2019;s attitude on ultraviolet radiation. </p> <br><b><p>Heliotherapy Takes Hold </p></b><p>By the beginning of the twentieth century, scientists had determined that it was the UV radiation in sunlight that stimulated the production of vitamin D in the human body. They deduced th...</p></p><h2>Empty Hands, A Memoir: One Woman&#39;s Journey to Save Children Orphaned by AIDS in South Africa (Sacred Activism)</h2><p><i>Empty Hands</i> is the inspiring memoir of Zulu nurse and healthcare activist Sister Abegail Ntleko. Growing up poor in a rural village with a father who didn't believe in educating girls, against seemingly insurmountable odds Sister Abegail earned her nursing degree and began work as a community nurse and educator, dedicating her life to those in need. "Her story tells us," says&nbsp;Desmond Tutu, who wrote the foreword to the book, "what a single person can accomplish when heart and&nbsp;mind work together in the service of others."<br><br>Overcoming poverty and racism within the apartheid South African system, she adopted her first child at a time when it was unheard of to do so. And then she did it again and again.

Now 79 years old, Sister Abe has built and managed two orphanages serving hundreds of young people and has helped thousands of children and families affected by HIV.

When her mother died, relatives took in her youngest siblings while her older sisters married or found work. At age 6, she found herself alone to care for herself and her alcoholic father. Working as a laundress and, later, a field hand, and with no time to make friends her age, the author's main source of moral support came from an English missionary worker, who taught Ntleko the lesson that would become her life mantra: &#x201c;if you want to be of help and service to others...get an education.&#x201d; At 14, she began school, against the wishes of her tradition-bound father. Getting only a few hours of sleep each night, she worked tirelessly to make her dreams come true. She even ran away from home to earn the money her father could not give her to continue her studies. Ntleko was 28 when she graduated from high school and began her training as a nurse. Yet it was not until she adopted the first of many children a few years later that she realized her true calling was to help homeless youngsters. Ntleko tackled the challenges of single parenthood in the 1960s; more than a decade later, she found herself tackling the even greater challenge of the AIDS crisis. She eventually founded two organizations, Clouds of Hope and Kulungile, dedicated to providing shelter for children from AIDS-affected families.

A young Massachusetts native, Francis was only three years removed from his youthful career as a lowly caddie. Harry was twice his age, the greatest British champion in history, and innovator of the modern grip and swing. Through exacting hard work, perseverance, and determination, Harry Vardon had escaped a hopeless life of poverty; the unknown Ouimet dared to dream of following in his hero's footsteps. When the two men finally came together in their legendary battle at the 1913 US Open, its heart-stopping climax gave rise to the sport of golf as we know it today.<br><br>Weaving the stories of Ouimet and Vardon as his narrative, Mark Frost creates a uniquely involving, intimate epic that is equal parts sports biography, sweeping social history, and emotional human drama. <b><i>The Greatest Game Ever Played</i></b> is a must-listen for millions of sports and history fans - and all who have ever dared to reach for their dreams.<br><br></p><p><b>Mark Frost</b> received a Writers Guild Award and an Emmy nomination for the acclaimed television series <i>Hill Street Blues</i> and was co-creator and executive producer of the legendary television series <i>Twin Peaks</i>. In 2005 he wrote and produced <i>The Greatest Game Ever Played</i>, a major motion picture based on his book of the same name. An avid golfer, Frost lives in Los Angeles and upstate New York with his wife and son.<br><br>*Starred Review* The story of Francis Ouimet, the first amateur to win the U.S. Open golf tournament, is just too good to be true: it's <i>Rocky</i> without the sequels, it's Jack without his beanstalk, it's Tiger without Nike. But it's true, and as told by veteran thriller writer Frost, it's the most compelling sports book since Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling <i>Seabiscuit</i>. Born in 1893, Ouimet grew up poor, directly across the street from The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, where Boston's blue bloods tried their hands at the new sport of golf. The game caught young Francis in its grip, and despite his father's disapproval, he became a caddie at the club and taught himself to play. Frost jumps between Ouimet's story and the surprisingly similar saga of British champion Harry Vardon, who was also born poor and contended with a disapproving father. Frost builds his characters--not just Ouimet and Vardon but also Francis' caddy, 10-year-old Eddie Lowery--with the skill of a novelist (occasionally but believably using invented dialogue). The climax of the narrative--the recounting of the 1913 U.S. Open at Brookline, where the unheralded, 20-year-old Ouimet beat both his idol Vardon and the other reigning British professional, Ted Ray--is genuinely exciting, a marvelous re-creation of a signature moment in golf history. Underdog stories have become among the sappiest cliches in pop-culture's arsenal, but this one reminds us why they worked in the first place. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She lives in Easthampton,Massachusetts.Gr 3&#x2013;7&#x2014;This classic, enigmatic Victorian fairy tale of two children who find, lose, and then find each other again as they search for "the place from which the shadows fall" is given a new treatment by Sanderson. The artist has divided the work into nine short chapters and illustrated it with more than 45 bold black-and-white scratchboard pictures. Mossy discovers the key he has heard about in his great-aunt's stories and is charged with locating the lock into which it fits; Tangle, a neglected orphan, follows a magical fish to a hidden cottage where a beautiful woman takes her in and lovingly cares for her. Here the two meet and venture on a quest, developing a deep friendship, then losing each other, until, with the help of special beings and magical creatures, they are reunited in a new life. Unlike Maurice Sendak's soft, evocative illustrations in an older edition (Farrar, 1967), Sanderson's is deeply textured and dramatic, enhancing the vivid imagery of the narrative with many full pages and spreads. An afterword by Jane Yolen provides a snapshot of MacDonald's life and explores her experience of the story over time. An illustrator's note describes how Sanderson came to reformat and pictorially interpret the mysterious tale. Young readers may be puzzled by the narrative but will likely enjoy the magic, intriguing characters, and richly detailed illustrations; older readers may recognize religious or metaphorical elements.

Nearly all the essays are a pleasure to read and some it almost seems shocking to say it are works of beauty. It has happened before one thinks of Keat's letters and some fragments of Lawrence that the unlikely combination of criticism, philosophy and metaphorical inventiveness has resulted in a kind of poetry." --New York Times Book Review<br><br>"For anyone who writes fiction or writes about it, or reads fiction for the solacing sense of potential reality it can provided, Gass's book is the most important and bracing theoretical study I know of.

Losses loom on the horizon: elderly grandparents who can no longer stay on the family farm; her nephew Slate, who longs to leave for a home of his own; her brother Danny and his wife, who leave for Kenya; and Mindy, whom Virginia has raised as her own daughter but who may be torn away from the ones she loves by a cold-hearted birth mother.<p> "That's how life is," Virginia tells Mindy. "Things just keep being... different." Virginia has always dreaded and fought change. Now, can she embrace it?</p><p> In this fourth volume of the Prairie Legacy series, bestselling author Janette Oke gently opens a window into the life of a close-knit family trying to find its way through bewildering times. In her own quiet-paced, inimitable style, she examines the role that change plays in our lives and how we are shaped--or broken--by it. Longtime fans of this inspirational author will find no big shocks or surprises here. Just vintage Oke. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i></p>The small figure reached for another dinner plate and began the drying process, but her mind seemed distracted as the towel went round and round, drying the same spot over and over. Virginia was totally unprepared when Mindy looked up and asked, &#34;Did my other mama love me?&#34; Virginia felt the air leave her lungs. What in the world could she say to that? She could notwould notlie to the child. They had never lied to Mindy. She had grown up knowing that she had another set of parents. They were never referred to as the &#34;real&#34; mother and father but always the &#34;other&#34; mother and father. It had been explained that her father had been killed in a car accident, that her mother was living in another city, very sad over the loss. The facts, after once presented, were never discussed unless Mindy brought them up, then her few questions were answered in a matter-of-fact, non-evasive manner. But this? This had never come up before. Virginia&#39;s mind scrambled for satisfactory words. Honest words. What could she say? Would it destroy her daughters newly awakened faith? &#34;Let&#39;s sit downand talk,&#34; she began, her words faltering, her hand on Mindy&#39;s shoulder. &#34;It&#39;s okay,&#34; said Mindy. &#34;We can finish the dishes.&#34; How could Virginia answer their daughters incredibly complex question?</p><h2>Water Wars: Privatization, Pollution, and Profit</h2><p><p>While draught and desertification are intensifying around the world, corporations are aggressively converting free-flowing water into bottled profits. The water wars of the twenty-first century may match&#x2014;or even surpass&#x2014;the oil wars of the twentieth.

No bibliography. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>The Dalai Lama's autobiography should leave no one in doubt of his humility and genuine compassion. Written without the slightest hint of pretense, the exiled leader of Tibet recounts his life, from the time he was whisked away from his home in 1939 at the age of 4, to his treacherous escape from Tibet in 1959, to his winning of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. The backdrop of the story is the 1950 Chinese invasion of Tibet. He calmly relates details of imprisonment, torture, rape, famine, ecological disaster, and genocide that under four decades of Chinese rule have left 1.25 million Tibetans dead and the Tibetan natural and religious landscapes decimated. Yet the Dalai Lama's story is strangely one of hope. This man who prays for four hours a day harbors no ill will toward the Chinese and sees the potential for good everywhere he casts his gaze. Someday, he hopes, all of Tibet will be a zone of peace and the world's largest nature preserve. Such optimism is not naive but rather a result of his daily studies in Buddhist philosophy and his doctrine of Universal Responsibility. Inspiring in every way, <i>Freedom in Exile</i> is both a historical document and a fable of deepest trust in humanity. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>The Dalai Lama is the head of the Buddhist &#39;religion&#39;. He was chosen to be the reincarnation of all the previous Dalai Lamas as a two year old boy.</p><h2>Alexander Dumas&#39; Dictionary of Cuisine</h2><p>Briefly describes the history of food and cooking, defines cooking terms, methods, and ingredients, and includes recipes</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Mandie and the Mysterious Fisherman (Mandie, Book 19)</h2><p>&#34;My friends and I are going Mandie book crazy!

At Matthew&#39;s ancestral home at Sept-Tours, they reunite with the cast of characters from A Discovery of Witches-with one significant exception.

In the trilogy&#39;s final volume, Harkness deepens her themes of power and passion, family and caring, past deeds and their present consequences. In ancestral homes and university laboratories, using ancient knowledge and modern science, from the hills of the Auvergne to the palaces of Venice and beyond, the couple at last learn what the witches discovered so many centuries ago.</p><p>Deborah Harkness is a historian of science and a professor of history at the University of Southern California.

It is the fourth house of the Zodiak. It signifies death and the end of thinges.<br><br></i></b><i>&#x2014;Anonymous English Commonplace Book, c. 1590,<br> Gon�alves MS 4890, f. 8r<br></i><br> Ghosts didn&#x2019;t have much substance. All they were composed of was memories and heart. Atop one of Sept-Tours&#x2019; round towers, Emily Mather pressed a diaphanous hand against the spot in the center of her chest that even now was heavy with dread.<br><br> <i>Does it ever get easier?</i>&nbsp;Her voice, like the rest of her, was almost imperceptible.&nbsp;<i>The watching? The waiting? The knowing?<br></i><br> <i>Not that I&#x2019;ve noticed,</i>&nbsp;Philippe de Clermont replied shortly. He was perched nearby, studying his own transparent fingers. Of all the things Philippe disliked about being dead&#x2014;the inability to touch his wife, Ysabeau; his lack of smell or taste; the fact that he had no muscles for a good sparring match&#x2014;invisibility topped the list. It was a constant reminder of how inconsequential he had become.<br><br> Emily&#x2019;s face fell, and Philippe silently cursed himself. Since she&#x2019;d died, the witch had been his constant companion, cutting his loneliness in two. What was he thinking, barking at her as if she were a servant?<br><br> <i>Perhaps it will be easier when they don&#x2019;t need us anymore,</i>&nbsp;Philippe said in a gentler tone. He might be the more experienced ghost, but it was Emily who understood the metaphysics of their situation. What the witch had told him went against everything Philippe believed about the afterworld. He thought the living saw the dead&nbsp;<i>because&nbsp;</i>they needed something from them: assistance, forgiveness, retribution. Emily insisted these were nothing more than human myths, and it was only when the living moved on and let go that the dead could appear to them.<br><br> This information made Ysabeau&#x2019;s failure to notice him somewhat easier to bear, but not much.<br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to see Em&#x2019;s reaction. She&#x2019;s going to be so surprised.&#x201d; Diana&#x2019;s warm alto floated up to the battlements.<br><br> <i>Diana and Matthew,</i>&nbsp;Emily and Philippe said in unison, peering down to the cobbled courtyard that surrounded the ch�teau.<br><br> <i>There,</i>&nbsp;Philippe said, pointing at the drive. Even dead, he had vampire sight that was sharper than any human&#x2019;s. He was also still handsomer than any man had a right to be, with his broad shoulders and devilish grin. He turned the latter on Emily, who couldn&#x2019;t help grinning back.&nbsp;<i>They are a fine couple, are they not? Look how much my son has changed.<br></i><br> Vampires weren&#x2019;t supposed to be altered by the passing of time, and therefore Emily expected to see the same black hair, so dark it glinted blue; the same mutable gray-green eyes, cool and remote as a winter sea; the same pale skin and wide mouth. There were a few subtle differences, though, as Philippe suggested. Matthew&#x2019;s hair was shorter, and he had a beard that made him look even more dangerous, like a pirate. She gasped.<br><br> <i>Is Matthew . . . bigger?<br></i><br> <i>He is. I fattened him up when he and Diana were here in 1590. Books were making him soft. Matthew needed to fight more and read less.&nbsp;</i>Philippe had always contended there was such a thing as too much education. Matthew was living proof of it.<br><br> <i>Diana looks different, too. More like her mother, with that long, coppery hair,</i>&nbsp;Em said, acknowledging the most obvious change in her niece.<br><br> Diana stumbled on a cobblestone, and Matthew&#x2019;s hand shot out to steady her. Once, Emily had seen Matthew&#x2019;s incessant hovering as a sign of vampire overprotectiveness. Now, with the perspicacity of a ghost, she realized that this tendency stemmed from his preternatural awareness of every change in Diana&#x2019;s expression, every shift of mood, every sign of fatigue or hunger. Today, however, Matthew&#x2019;s concern seemed even more focused and acute.<br><br> <i>It&#x2019;s not just Diana&#x2019;s hair that has changed.&nbsp;</i>Philippe&#x2019;s face had a look of wonder.&nbsp;<i>Diana is with child&#x2014;Matthew&#x2019;s child.<br></i><br> Emily examined her niece more carefully, using the enhanced grasp of truth that death afforded. Philippe was right&#x2014;in part.&nbsp;<i>You mean &#x201c;with&nbsp;</i>children.<i>&#x201d; Diana is having twins.<br></i><br> <i>Twins,&nbsp;</i>Philippe said in an awed voice. He looked away, distracted by the appearance of his wife.&nbsp;<i>Look, here are Ysabeau and Sarah with Sophie and Margaret.<br></i><br> <i>What will happen now, Philippe?</i>&nbsp;Emily asked, her heart growing heavier with anticipation.<br><br> <i>Endings. Beginnings,</i>&nbsp;Philippe said with deliberate vagueness.&nbsp;<i>Change.<br></i><br> <i>Diana has never liked change,&nbsp;</i>Emily said.<br><br> <i>That is because Diana is afraid of what she must become,&nbsp;</i>Philippe replied.<br><br> * * *<br><br> Marcus Whitmore had faced horrors aplenty since the night in 1781 when Matthew de Clermont made him a vampire. None had prepared him for today&#x2019;s ordeal: telling Diana Bishop that her beloved aunt, Emily Mather, was dead.<br><br> <i>Marcus had received the phone call from Ysabeau while he and Nathaniel Wilson were watching the television news in the family library. Sophie, Nathaniel&#x2019;s wife, and their baby, Margaret, were dozing on a nearby sofa.<br></i><br> <i>&#x201c;The temple,&#x201d; Ysabeau had said breathlessly, her tone frantic. &#x201c;Come. At once.&#x201d;<br></i><br> <i>Marcus had obeyed his grandmother without question, only taking time to shout for his cousin, Gallowglass, and his Aunt Verin on his way out the door.<br></i><br> <i>The summer half-light of evening had lightened further as he approached the clearing at the top of the mountain, brightened by the otherworldly power that Marcus glimpsed through the trees. His hair stood at attention at the magic in the air.<br></i><br> <i>Then he scented the presence of a vampire, Gerbert of Aurillac. And someone else&#x2014;a witch.<br></i><br> A light, purposeful step sounded down the stone corridor, drawing Marcus out of the past and back into the present. The heavy door opened, creaking as it always did.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello, sweetheart.&#x201d; Marcus turned from the view of the Auvergne countryside and drew a deep breath. Phoebe Taylor&#x2019;s scent reminded him of the thicket of lilac bushes that had grown outside the red-painted door of his family&#x2019;s farm. Delicate and resolute, the fragrance had symbolized the hope of spring after a long Massachusetts winter and conjured up his long-dead mother&#x2019;s understanding smile. Now it only made Marcus think of the petite, iron-willed woman before him.<br><br>&#x201c;Everything will be all right.&#x201d; Phoebe reached up and straightened his collar, her olive eyes full of concern. Marcus had taken to wearing more formal clothes than concert T-shirts around the same time he&#x2019;d started to sign his letters Marcus de Clermont instead of Marcus Whitmore&#x2014;the name she&#x2019;d first known him by, before he had told her about vampires, fifteen-hundred-year-old fathers, French castles full of forbidding relatives, and a witch named Diana Bishop. It was, in Marcus&#x2019;s opinion, nothing short of miraculous that Phoebe had remained at his side.<br><br>&#x201c;No. It won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He caught one of her hands and planted a kiss on the palm. Phoebe didn&#x2019;t know Matthew. &#x201c;Stay here with Nathaniel and the rest of them. Please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For the final time, Marcus Whitmore, I will be standing beside you when you greet your father and his wife. I don&#x2019;t believe we need discuss it further.&#x201d; Phoebe held out her hand. &#x201c;Shall we?&#x201d;<br><br>Marcus put his hand in Phoebe&#x2019;s, but instead of following her out the door as she expected, he tugged her toward him. Phoebe came to rest against his chest, one hand clasped in his and the other pressed to his heart. She looked at him with surprise.<br><br>&#x201c;Very well. But if you come down with me, Phoebe, there are conditions. First, you are with me or with Ysabeau at all times.&#x201d;<br><br>Phoebe opened her mouth to protest, but Marcus&#x2019;s serious look silenced her.<br><br>&#x201c;Second, if I tell you to leave the room, you will do so. No delay. No questions. Go straight to Fernando. He&#x2019;ll be in the chapel or the kitchen.&#x201d; Marcus searched her face and saw a wary acceptance. &#x201c;Third, do not, under any circumstances, get within arm&#x2019;s reach of my father. Agreed?&#x201d;<br><br> Phoebe nodded. Like any good diplomat, she was prepared to follow Marcus&#x2019;s rules&#x2014;for now. But if Marcus&#x2019;s father was the monster some in the house seemed to think he was, Phoebe would do what she must.</p><h2>The Secret of Creating Your Future</h2><p>The book gives you the specific process of HOW to change your unfulfilled dreams into actualizing your true wishes and expectations.</p><p></p><h2>Bullion Stitch Embroidery: From Roses to Wildflowers (Milner Craft Series)</h2><p>Provides instructions for embroidering roses, Australian wildflowers, and other flowers with the bullion stitch, and suggests a variety of projects using the stitch</p><p></p><h2>Grayson Vol. 4: A Ghost in the Tomb</h2><p>Acclaimed co-writers Tom King (BATMAN) and Tim Seeley (NIGHTWING), along with superstar artist Mikel Jan�n (JUSTICE LEAGUE DARK), deliver intense superspy action in the DC Universe with their fourth volume of the celebrated series that redefines Dick Grayson.<br><br> Dick Grayson&#x2014;the former Robin turned Nightwing turned superspy Agent 37&#x2014;is back to work at the covert global agency, Spyral.

A section covers relaxation and meditation and breathing techniques. Healing Mudras has a much narrower focus. Mudras, in Buddhism and Hinduism, are symbolic gestures involving hands, fingers, and arms that are used in ceremonies and dance or seen in artwork. Mesko, a former dancer and certified yoga therapist, takes a mindful and introspective approach combining movement with chants in order to achieve specific self-affirming goals. All 52 mudras are demonstrated with photos of the author, along with instructions for breathing, eye movements, and mantras, which spoken aloud impart greater mental and physical energy and a healing quality. Experienced yoga students seeking to move beyond the basic postures or individuals with physical limitations will find this guide useful. Both titles are easy to follow and understand. However, since a number of introductory yoga books are already available, Finger's is an optional purchase. Because it concentrates on a very specific aspect of yoga practice, Mesko's guide is a preferred choice for a wellness collection or public library with a limited budget seeking to round out its yoga collection.<br><i>-Deborah Anne Broocker, Georgia Perimeter Coll., Dunwoody </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Taste of Home Cookbook</h2><p>Complemented by more than seven hundred photographs and illustrations, this all-new cookbook features more than 1,200 homestyle, tested recipes, organized into twenty-five different chapters, along with hundreds of time-saving tips, tricks, and how-to instructions and five separate indexes--food category, major ingredient, alphabetical, cooking method, and tip/reference. 200,000 first printing.</p><p>Reader&#x2019;s Digest simplifies and enriches consumers&#x2019; lives by discovering and expertly selecting the most interesting ideas, stories, experiences and products in health, home, family, food, finance and humor.

Captain Alan Lewrie, fresh from victory in the South Atlantic, is back in England and fitting out his new frigate, the HMS Savage. But true to fashion, Lewrie can't stay ashore too long with out trouble arising. A Jamaican court has tried him in absentia and sentenced him to hang for the theft of a dozen Black slaves. The vengeful slave-owner has made his way to London to seek Lewrie's end . . . with or without the majesty of the law! </p><p>To complicate matters further, Lewrie must also deal with allegations that he is a faithless rakehell, his wife has informed through anonymous letters. Despite shoreside legal matters, Lewrie takes the Savage on King's business to Sou'west France to plug the threat of enemy warships, privateers, and neutrals smuggling goods in and out of Bordeaux. It could be dull and plodding dreariness, but a bored Captain Alan Lewrie, safe in his post (for the moment), can be a dangerous fellow to his country's foes . . . if only to relieve the tedium!</p></p><p><p>Dewey Lambdin is the author of thirteen previous Alan Lewrie novels. A member of the U.S. Naval Institute and a Friend of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, Lambdin has been a sailor since 1976, and he spends his free time working and sailing. He makes his home in Nashville, Tennessee, but would much prefer Margaritaville or Murrell's Inlet.</p>Chapter 1<br>Captain Alan Lewrie, RN, stepped out of the doors of the George Inn, just as the watch bells of a myriad of warships and merchant vessels in Portsmouth Harbour began to chime the end of the Morning Watch&#x2014;Eight Bells, and the start of the Forenoon&#x2014;in a distant, jangly ting-tinging much like what a rider near London might hear from church bells of a Sunday morning.<br>Not exactly a sound to set one&#x2019;s pocket-watch by, that chiming, for each ship depended on the turning of sand-glasses to measure hours and half hours, quarter hours for the Dog Watches, the initial turning of the glasses dependent on the vagaries of masters&#x2019; and captains&#x2019; time pieces, all of varying quality, accuracy, and cost.<br>Lewrie unconsciously drew his watch from a waist-coat pocket and found the time to be two and a half minutes past 8 a.m. Then he, as half a dozen other officers nearby did, put it to his ear to see if it was still ticking strongly. One much older Post-Captain growled under his breath, gave his a hard shake, and damned its maker with a muttered &#x201c;Christ . . . bloody cogs!&#x201d; before stalking off.<br>Lewrie merely shrugged, put his back in his waist-coat pocket, and lifted his gaze to savour the morning. And a fine morning it was, by Jove! There was ample early summer sunshine, and the sky was barely dappled with thinly scattered and quick-scudding light clouds. Flags and vanes showed the wind had come about from the Nor&#x2019;east, and in some strength, too, for the flies of those flags were snapping chearly, the halliards chattering against the flagpoles. Weather vanes on rooves squeaked and jiggled to a relatively brisk breeze.<br>Lewrie resettled his cocked hat on his head, and, now alone on the walkway as the other officers headed away on their own occasions, allowed himself a most satisfying belch&#x2014;not a well-stifled, gentlemanly thing, but a rather long, and loud, eructation; for in all of Portsmouth there was no breakfast finer than that served at the George Inn, and his morning repast of two eggs fried not quite to hard, with fried and grated potatoes, a chop-sized hank of flank beef, and bread sliced two finger-joints thick, toasted to perfection, then slathered with fresh butter and Kentish apple preserves, had been perfection . . . and, sluiced down with three cups of coffee fetched to his table half-scalding, to boot . . . well!<br>That belch, in point of fact, was so savoury that Lewrie allowed himself a second before taking hold of the scabbard of his hundred-guinea presentation small-sword to restrict its swinging, and set off towards the quays, and the King&#x2019;s Stairs, where he would take a hired boat back to his new frigate.<br>The morning was so clear and bright that even before he got to the King&#x2019;s Stairs, Lewrie could espy dozens of sail making the most of the shift of wind to head down-Channel for the Atlantic. Nearer to, at least a dozen warships were falling down to St. Helen&#x2019;s Patch, down to the Isle of Wight and the open sea, after being cooped up in port for a fortnight or more, awaiting a favourable slant of wind and a moderation in the weather.<br>To be back at sea! Were Savage in any respects ready to sail, what a grand morning&#x2019;s departure it would be, but, alas, his frigate still lay to anchor with both bowers and both stern kedges down, with her upper masts and rigging stripped &#x201c;to a gant-line&#x201d; for re-rigging and re-masting to his satisfaction. Her jib-boom and bowsprit had been steeved to a lower angle, whole new sets of inner and outer jibs cut and sewn, and the Sailmaker and his crew ready to make new fore-and-aft stays&#x2019;ls to Lewrie&#x2019;s requirements, once the upper masts were set in place . . . all to aid HMS Savage to &#x201c;point&#x201d; just a half, or a quarter, point closer to the eyes of the winds.<br>The sooner, the better, pray Jesus! Lewrie fretfully thought, his good mood and joy of a good breakfast curdled by the dread that he might not stay free long enough to skitter over the horizon, out of reach of his pending legal troubles . . . and the adamantine wrath of the Beauman family.<br>No wonder the others were peerin&#x2019; at me so odd, Lewrie thought as he reached the stone quays; wond&#x2019;rin&#x2019; whether I&#x2019;m saint or felon.<br>The George Inn was one of the better establishments in Portsmouth, the favourite of senior naval officers, so he had been among an host of Rear-Admirals, a Commodore or three, and Post-Captains of more than Three Years&#x2019; Seniority, like himself, &#x201c;salted enough&#x201d; to wear a pair of gilt-lace epaulets on their shoulders. They&#x2019;d seemed polite and civil enough, some smiling as they pointed him out to their table companions and gave him a nod. Others, well . . . <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Lewrie, don&#x2019;t ye know . . . pile o&#x2019; &#x2019;tin&#x2019; in the West Indies . . . the &#x2018;Ram-Cat,&#x2019; he&#x2019;s called, and God pity his poor wife . . . at Cape Saint Vincent and Camperdown, both, with the medals for &#x2019;em . . . a fight near Cape Town in early spring, took a bigger French frigate . . . two-hour fight in a blowin&#x2019; gale, I heard . . . got his frigate out from the Nore during the Mutiny . . . oh, in all the papers, and such &#x2019;cause he stole Jamaican slaves t&#x2019;crew his ship . . . darlin&#x2019; of the Abolition crowd, and Wilberforce, so please ye! &#x2018;Black Alan&#x2019; Lewrie now, haw-haw . . . soon t&#x2019;hang, I heard, God rot &#x2019;im! Aye, and Wilberforce, too . . . demned &#x2018;reformers&#x2019; and &#x2018;kill-joys&#x2019;!&#x201d;<br>Lewrie had heard rumours from his new allies in the Society for the Abolition of Slavery in the British Empire, the Reverend William Wilberforce and his coterie, that the Beauman family, already about as fond of him as cold, boiled mutton, had departed Jamaica for England.<br>Now they&#x2019;d finally discovered just who it was who stole their dozen prime field hands from one of their many plantations, the one on the shore of Portland Bight (well, sort of, kind of, recruited or received, not stolen exactly!), they were come with vengeance running hot in their spleens to see him tried, convicted, stripped of all of his wealth and property, cashiered from the Royal Navy, then most publicly and satisfyingly carted to Tyburn and hung from a gibbet, to the taunts from the Mob, and the Huzzahs of the Beaumans.<br>Never should&#x2019;ve shot their damned cousin in that duel, Lewrie silently rued, grimly recalling when he&#x2019;d seconded his old friend Kit Cashman, who&#x2019;d drilled the youngest Beauman brother, Ledyard, right in the belly, too, who&#x2019;d taken five agonising days to die after they had scandalously violated the rules of honour with a back-shot, and extra, hidden pistols. Though it was satisfyin&#x2019; . . . <br>Most of the bumboats and boats for hire were scurrying about from vessel to vessel, and for the moment, only two remained tied to the landing, their shabby bundled or furled sails rustling and snapping to the breeze, and frayed rope halliards chattering against their short masts, the blocks clattering and squealing. Lewrie paused from choosing, taking a long look seaward. It was such a clear and sunny day that he could even see far up-channel into the main anchorage of Spithead, past Gilkicker Point into the little-used and shallow channel of Needles Passage round the west end of the Isle of Wight. Redcoats standing sentry-go on the ramparts of the Monckton Fort could be spotted individually. To the east, he could even make out the heights of Selsey Bill, for a rare wonder.<br>And there was his brand-new frigate, HMS Savage, anchored not five cables offshore, and as shiny as a new-minted penny, just fresh from the graving docks. Her new hull paint, tar, and pitch shone in the morning light, every glitter of sunshine on the cat&#x2019;s-pawed harbour waters reflected down her sleek flanks like a continual shower of diamond chips. She floated light and high, less her guns and stores, which still sat ashore in warehouses and armouries at Gun Wharf, or among the goods from the Victualling Board&#x2019;s vast depot, and fresh copper cladding, normally below the waterline, flickered with dapples of sun like a horizontal sheet of gold or brass.<br>She was a Fifth Rate 18-pounder of over 950 tons burthen, the largest, longest, best-armed ship Lewrie had ever been appointed to command, and the thought of losing captaincy over her was as painful as the dread of dying. She was long, lean, and powerful-looking with such a sweet, aggressive curve to her sheerline and gunwale, with an entry and forefoot finer and leaner than the usual bluff bowed ships built in British yards. She was a leashed greyhound! A French greyhound, Lewrie had to remind himself; even so, though . . . <br>The French had built her at Brest, of stout Hamburg oak before the outbreak of the war in 1792, and commissioned in the vicious and bloody turmoil of the Terror in &#x2019;93, named in honour of the crackpot ideas of the philosopher Rousseau as Le Sauvage Noble. Sent out to an ignoble sacrifice, Lewrie had learned, for with all the former aristocratic or Royalist-leaning officers of the French Navy dismissed from the service, hunted down for trial and humiliation by the revolutionaries, imprisoned for a time were they lucky . . . their heads chopped off by the heavy, wicked blade of the guillotine were they not . . . she had been captained, and her semi-hapless crew led, by former Bosun&#x2019;s Mates and matelots with the &#x201c;proper&#x201d; revolutionary attitudes and viewpoints. When she ran afoul of a lighter-gunned British frigate off Rochefort a year later, in &#x2019;94, all her grace and power had gone for nought and she had abjectly surrendered after a mere quarter-hour&#x2019;s pounding!<br>Re-named HMS Savage, taking the name of a much older Sixth Rate of 16 guns that had gone to the brea...</p><h2>The Bertie Project (44 Scotland Street)</h2><p>Bertie&#x2019;s mother, Irene, returns from the Middle East to discover that, in her absence, her son has been exposed to the worst of evils &#x2014; television shows, ice cream parlors, and even unsanctioned art at the National Portrait Gallery.

At least two of this last group were present early that evening&#x2014;Angus Lordie, portrait painter and owner of the dog, Cyril, and his friend, Matthew, proprietor of a small art gallery on Dundas Street, husband of Elspeth, and father of the robust and increasingly rumbustious triplets, Tobermory, Rognvald, and Fergus. Cyril, the only dog in Scotland to have a gold tooth, and the only dog anywhere to have been trained to lift his leg at the mention of the controversial conceptual art award, the Turner Prize, was also there, lying contentedly beneath the table at which Matthew and Angus sat. Underneath this table was to be seen an empty metal bowl, licked clean of the dark stout poured into it only ten minutes earlier, and the consumption of which had induced Cyril&#x2019;s state of somnolent contentment.<br><br>&#x201c;Your dog,&#x201d; observed Matthew, &#x201c;really is a most peculiar creature. I&#x2019;ve never quite worked him out, you know. He keeps looking at me in a distinctly disconcerting way.&#x201d;<br><br>Angus glanced down at Cyril. Although one of the dog&#x2019;s eyes was closed, he saw that the other, half-open, was focused on Matthew&#x2019;s feet.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s as if he had something against me,&#x201d; Matthew continued. &#x201c;Some canine grudge perhaps.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t think Cyril dislikes you. Quite the opposite, in fact.&#x201d; Angus smiled at Matthew. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that he&#x2019;s always had this thing about your ankles.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He nipped me,&#x201d; said Matthew accusingly. &#x201c;Remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. That was when he couldn&#x2019;t control himself any further. He yielded to temptation.&#x201d; Angus paused, ready to defend his dog. &#x201c;We all have our temptations, don&#x2019;t we? Some hidden desire, something we&#x2019;re perhaps a bit ashamed of. Nobody&#x2019;s immune to that.&#x201d; He paused again, before concluding, &#x201c;Chocolate . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew stared at Angus. He blushed. He had yielded to temptation only that afternoon, eating an entire bar of expensive Belgian chocolate bought by his assistant, Pat, as a birthday present for Elspeth. The chocolate had been entrusted to him, beautifully wrapped, for delivery to Elspeth, and he had sat and gazed at it, struggling with temptation, until at last he had succumbed. He had then eaten it in a single sitting when Pat went to post some letters, afterwards concealing the wrapping in the drawer of his desk. He had told himself that he would replace it in good time and that Elspeth would never know. But it was, he later decided, an entirely shameful thing to do&#x2014;no different from the act of a postman who steals a parcel, or a charity collector who pockets donations. Was it possible that Angus had guessed what he had done? That seemed so unlikely, and yet why else would he suddenly bring chocolate into the conversation?<br><br>He dismissed his scruples; it was hardly anything to get into a <i>fankle</i> over, hardly an issue at all . . . chocolate was a fungible, after all; something that could be replaced by more of the same. A <i>fankle</i>&#x2014;the Scots word seemed just right for its purpose, as so many Scots words did; a <i>fankle</i> was a mess, a state of confusion, sometimes leading to a <i>stramash</i>&#x2014;another useful Scots word&#x2014;and it was something one sought to avoid if at all possible.<br><br>Angus raised his glass to his lips. Having broached the topic of temptation, he was keen to abandon the subject. He himself experienced the occasional temptation&#x2014;nothing serious, of course, and barely anti-social&#x2014;but he was not sure that he would actually own up to such thoughts. Better, though, to think about something else altogether, which was, of course, a recommended way of tackling temptation in the first place.<br><br>But it was Matthew who moved the conversation on. &#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Be that as it may, have you seen the plans for that new building?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus had, and sighed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think . . .&#x201d; he began, and then stopped. There was not much one could add, he felt, to the charges of gross Philistinism that had already been levelled at the developers.<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; said Matthew, &#x201c;you&#x2019;d think, wouldn&#x2019;t you? However, I just don&#x2019;t have the energy to protest. I know I should; I know we should all rise up as one and flood the council with objections, but do they care? Does anyone actually imagine they give any weight to the likes of us, Angus? Les citoyens?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus thought for a moment, and then answered, &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So perhaps we should just give the matter a Gallic shrug . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Angus looked puzzled. &#x201c;A Gallic shrug?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The French are always shrugging,&#x201d; explained Matthew. &#x201c;You ask their view on things and they give a sort of insouciant shrug, as if to say that these things happen and they, at least, are completely unsurprised.&#x201d;<br><br>Angus knew what Matthew meant. He remembered a visit that he and Domenica had been paid by a French anthropologist a few months previously. The topic of French politics had cropped up in the conversation&#x2014;there was a long and crippling strike in France, with the government digging in against virtually everybody&#x2014;and the French visitor had simply shrugged. <i>Pouf!</i> he had said, adding, for clarification,<i> Bif!</i><br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps a shrug is not such a bad response,&#x201d; Angus said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the alternative? Getting all steamed up? Hot under the&nbsp;collar? You end up being angry&#x2014;outraged even&#x2014;but does that actually do any good?&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew himself was about to shrug, but stopped in time. One could not pronounce on shrugs with a shrug. &#x201c;I suppose that a shrug indicates acceptance,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Which is what we should all cultivate,&#x201d; added Angus. <br><br>&#x201c;Those who accept things are calmer, more resolved . . . and, I imagine, live much longer than those who rail against them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; said Matthew.&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t abide moaning,&#x201d; said Angus, taking a sip of his beer. &#x201c;Moaning gets us nowhere. It confirms the moaner in his state of discontent, and it irritates those who have to listen to the complaints.&#x201d; He paused, and looked enquiringly at Matthew. <br><br>&#x201c;Have I told you about my knee?&#x201d; he asked.Matthew shook his head. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re having knee trouble?&#x201d;&#x201c;A bit,&#x201d; said Angus. He looked at his beer glass, half full, with an expression of regret. &#x201c;I can only have one beer; you know&#x2014;because of my knee.&#x201d;<br><br>Matthew frowned. &#x201c;Because of your knee?&#x201d;<br><br>Angus told him. &#x201c;You see what happened,&#x201d; he began, &#x201c;is this . . .&#x201d;</p><h2>The Sun King&#39;s Garden</h2><p>Used.

A contributing writer to the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, his work has also appeared in <em>Vanity Fair, Esquire, Harper's</em> and <em>Outside</em>. He is also the author of novels <em>Moonlight Hotel</em> and <em>Triage</em> and of non-fiction books <em>The Man Who Tried to Save the World</em> and <em>The 4 O'Clock Murders</em>, and co-author of <em>War Zones</em> and <em>Inside The League</em> with his brother Jon Lee Anderson. </strong></p> <p>To truly understand the grim march of twentieth century history, one must start with World War I &#x2013; and to truly understand that horror show, one must look at its cataclysmic first few months. It was during this time that Europe saw sweeping military offensives, great pitched battles, and such staggering body-counts that the powers turned to the stagnation of trench warfare almost as a matter of national survival. This is the period British historian Max Hastings sets out to examine in <em>Catastrophe</em>, and the result is nothing short of a masterpiece. </p> <p>The power of this book operates on several levels. Due to the political and military complexity of World War I &#x2013; as well as, perhaps, a certain nationalistic chauvinism &#x2013; most histories of it tend to be decidedly local; a reader might learn a great deal about the battle of the Somme, for instance, but virtually nothing about what was occurring at the same time elsewhere. By deftly moving from one battlefront to the other, Hastings is able to create a mosaic of the carnage visited upon Europe in the opening days of the war, and to show how those fronts were interconnected. Certainly no other general World War I history that I&#x2019;ve read gives the commensurate attention to the slaughters that occurred on the Serbian and Galician battlefronts in 1914 that Hastings provides here.</p> <p>To accomplish this, he has wisely avoided that tendency so common among military historians - barraging the reader with a blizzard of commanders&#x2019; names and regimental designations &#x2013; that can make reading about combat such an ironically-dull task. Instead, by bringing us the voices of the young men from all sides caught in the maws of these battles, we not only get a visceral sense of what it looked and sounded and smelled like, but an appreciation for the commonality of the horror befalling them. Those wanting a tactical, blow-by-blow account of the Russian disasters at Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes, for example, will have to look elsewhere &#x2013; Hastings dispenses with these twinned battles in a mere dozen pages &#x2013; but for everyone else, the description of ordinary Russians slowly dawning to the realization that they are doomed is both wrenching and unforgettable. </p> <p>Perhaps most remarkable, given his focus on the personal and the small, telling detail, Hastings&#x2019; voice also carries the mantle of authority; very early on, the reader realizes the author has done the heavy spadework of examining the myriad political and military controversies of the period, and come to a studied conclusion. Chief among these is the enduring debate over who was most responsible for starting the war, and in recent years a whole spate of revisionist histories have sought to redirect blame toward Britain or France or &#x2013; most improbably - Russia. While Hastings is ultimately dismissive of these alternate theories (it really was the Germans&#x2019; and Austro-Hungarians&#x2019; fault), he does so decorously and only after entertaining the revisionisms long enough to show their contradictions. Similarly, the battlefield decisions of Sir John French, the first British field marshal of the war, have been argued over for nearly a century now, but it&#x2019;s very hard to see what needs to be added to Hastings&#x2019; elegant comment that French&#x2019;s conduct, &#x201c;in the field was little more egregious than that of his counterparts of the other European armies.&#x201d;</p> <p>In contemplating this project, it surely crossed Hastings&#x2019; mind that his book would inevitably be judged against another work that covers almost precisely the same time period, Barbara Tuchman&#x2019;s 1962 classic, <em>The Guns of August</em>. With <em>Catastrophe</em>, that period now has two classics. </p>Max Hastings is the author of more than twenty books, including&nbsp;<i>Catastrophe 1914: Europe Goes to War,</i>&nbsp;<i>Inferno: The World at War, 1939&#x2013;1945,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Winston's War: Churchill 1940-1945.</i>&nbsp;He spent his early career as a foreign correspondent for BBC TV and various newspapers, then as editor of Britain&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Evening Standard</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Daily Telegraph</i>. He has received numerous awards for both his books and his journalism. He lives in the English countryside west of London.</p><h2>Don&#39;t Push the River</h2><p>&#34;Don&#39;t Push the River&#34; is a first-person account of the author&#39;s use of Gestalt Therapy and the ways of Zen, Krishnamurti and the American Indian to deepen and expand personal experience and work through difficulties. &#34;We have to turn ourselves upside down and reverse our approach to life.&#34; This autobiographical episode shows the author doing this during a three-month period in association with Fritz Perls at the Gestalt Institute of Canada in 1969.</p><p></p><h2>Slouching Toward Nirvana: New Poems</h2><p><p>Charles Bukowski is one of America's best-known contemporary writers of poetry and prose, and, many would claim, its most influential and imitated poet.

He was raised in Los Angeles and lived there for fifty years. He published his first story in 1944 when he was twenty-four and began writing poetry at the age of thirty-five. He died in San Pedro, California, on March 9, 1994, at the age of seventy-three, shortly after completing his last novel, <strong>Pulp</strong> (1994).</p><p>During his lifetime Bukowski published more than forty-five books of poetry and prose, including the novels <strong>Post Office</strong> (1971), <strong>Factotum</strong> (1975), <strong>Women</strong> (1978), <strong>Ham on Rye</strong> (1982), and <strong>Hollywood</strong> (1989).

Like many another Buk collection, this one comes in four parts. To see just how good it is, turn to part 2, indicatively introduced by these lines: "There's a lioness / down the hallway // put on your lion's mask / and wait." The section's theme is women: Buk's women, lioness-like, indeed. Approach with caution or, better, as he says, wait. Beauty or, like Buk, beast, each is as sexy, feisty, crude, and smart (sometimes) as he is. These seemingly artless (<i>you</i> try to write anything good in Bukowski's dribble-down-the-page free style) rants, matched here in force and humor by the ones not about women, are the poetic analogs of the man-woman stuff in the pages of tough-guy novelists from Spillane and Thompson^B to Leonard. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Fifty years after its original publication, <i>The Bottom of the Harbor</i> is still considered a fundamental New York book. Every story Mitchell tells, every person he introduces, every scene he describes is illuminated by his passion for the eccentrics and eccentricities of his beloved adopted city.<br><br>All of the pieces here are connected in one way or another--some directly, some with a kind of mysterious circuitousness--to New York's fabled waterfront, the terrain that Mitchell brilliantly made his own. They tell of a life that has passed--of vacant hotel rooms, deserted communities, once-thriving fishing areas that are now polluted and studded with wrecks. Included are "Up in the Old Hotel," a portrait of Louis Morino, the proprietor of a restaurant called (to his disgust) Sloppy Louie's; "The Rats on the Waterfront," which has inspired countless writers to attempt portraits of these most demonized New Yorkers; and "Mr. Hunter's Grave," widely considered to be the finest single piece of nonfiction to have ever appeared in the pages of <i>The New Yorker.<br><br></i>Here is the essential work of a legendary writer.</p><p>Joseph Mitchell came to New York from North Carolina the day after the 1929 stock market crash.

I usually arrive around five-thirty, and take a walk through the two huge open-fronted market sheds, the Old Market and the New Market, whose fronts rest on South Street and whose backs rest on piles in the East River. At that time, a little while before the trading begins, the stands in the sheds are heaped high and spilling over with forty to sixty kinds of finfish and shellfish from the East Coast, the West Coast, the Gulf Coast, and half a dozen foreign countries. The smoky riverbank dawn, the racket the fishmongers make, the seaweedy smell, and the sight of this plentifulness always give me a feeling of well-being, and sometimes they elate me. I wander among the stands for an hour or so. Then I go into a cheerful market restaurant named Sloppy Louie&#x2019;s and eat a big, inexpensive, invigorating breakfast&#x2014;a kippered herring and scrambled eggs, or a shad-roe omelet, or split sea scallops and bacon, or some other breakfast specialty of the place.<br><br>Sloppy Louie&#x2019;s occupies the ground floor of an old building at 92 South Street, diagonally across the street from the sheds. This building faces the river and looks out on the slip between the Fulton Street fish pier and the Old Porto Rico Line dock. It is six floors high, and it has two windows to the floor. Like the majority of the older buildings in the market district, it is made of hand-molded Hudson River brick, a rosy-pink and relatively narrow kind that used to be turned out in Haverstraw and other kiln towns on the Hudson and sent down to the city in barges. It has an ornamented tin cornice and a slate-covered mansard roof. It is one of those handsome, symmetrical old East River waterfront buildings that have been allowed to dilapidate. The windows of its four upper floors have been boarded over for many years, a rain pipe that runs down the front of it is riddled with rust holes, and there are gaps here and there on its mansard where slates have slipped off. In the afternoons, after two or three, when the trading is over and the stands begin to close, some of the slimy, overfed gulls that scavenge in the market roost along its cornice, hunched up and gazing downward.<br><br>I have been going to Sloppy Louie&#x2019;s for nine or ten years, and the proprietor and I are old friends. His name is Louis Morino, and he is a contemplative and generous and worldly-wise man in his middle sixties. Louie is a North Italian. He was born in Recco, a fishing and bathing-beach village thirteen miles southeast of Genoa, on the Eastern Riviera. Recco is ancient; it dates back to the third century. Families in Genoa and Milan and Turin own villas in and around it, and go there in the summer. Some seasons, a few English and Americans show up. According to a row of colored-postcard views of it Scotch-taped to a mirror on the wall in back of Louie&#x2019;s cash register, it is a village of steep streets and tall, square, whitewashed stone houses. The fronts of the houses are decorated with stenciled designs&#x2014;madonnas, angels, flowers, fruit, and fish. The fish design is believed to protect against the evil eye and appears most often over doors and windows. Big, lush fig bushes grow in almost every yard. In the center of the village is an open-air market where fishermen and farmers sell their produce off plank-and-sawhorse counters. Louie&#x2019;s father was a fisherman. His name was Giuseppe Morino, and he was called, in Genoese dialect, Beppe du Russu, or Joe the Redhead. &#x201c;My family was one of the old fishing families in Recco that the priest used to tell us had been fishing along that coast since Roman times,&#x201d; Louie says. &#x201c;We lived on a street named the Vico Saporito that was paved with broken-up sea shells and wound in and out and led down to the water. My father did a kind of fishing that&#x2019;s called haul-seining over here, and he set lobster traps and jigged for squid and bobbed for octopuses. When the weather was right, he used to row out to an underwater cave he knew about and anchor over it and take a bob consisting of a long line with scraps of raw meat hung from it every foot or so and a stone on the end of it and drop it in the mouth of the cave, and the octopuses would shoot up out of the dark down there and swallow the meat scraps and that would hold them, and then my father would draw the bob up slow and steady and pull the octopuses loose from the meat scraps one by one and toss them in a tub in the boat. He&#x2019;d bob up enough octopuses in a couple of hours to glut the market in Recco. This cave was full of octopuses; it was choked with them. He had found it, and he had the rights to it. The other fishermen didn&#x2019;t go near it; they called it Beppe du Russu&#x2019;s cave. In addition to fishing, he kept a rickety old bathhouse on the beach for the summer people. It stood on stilts, and I judge it had fifty to sixty rooms. We called it the Bagni Margherita. My mother ran a little buffet in connection with it.&#x201d;<br><br>Louie left Recco in 1905, when he was close to eighteen. &#x201c;I loved my family,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;and it tore me in two to leave, but I have five brothers and two sisters, and all my brothers were younger than me, and there were already too many fishermen in Recco, and the bathhouse brought in just so much, and I had a persisting fear there might not be enough at home to go around in time to come, so I got passage from Genoa to New York scrubbing pots in the galley of a steamship and went straight from the dock to a chop-house on East 138th Street in the Bronx that was operated by a man named Capurro who came from Recco. Capurro knew my father when they both were boys.&#x201d; Capurro gave Louie a job washing dishes and taught him how to wait on tables. He stayed there two years. For the next twenty-three years, he worked as a waiter in restaurants all over Manhattan and Brooklyn. He has forgotten how many he worked in; he can recall the names of thirteen. Most of them were medium-size restaurants of the Steaks-&amp;-Chops, We-Specialize-in-Seafood, Tables-for-Ladies type. In the winter of 1930, he decided to risk his savings and become his own boss. &#x201c;At that time,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;the stock-market crash had shook everything up and the depression was setting in, and I knew of several restaurants in midtown that could be bought at a bargain&#x2014;lease, furnishings, and good will. All were up-to-date places. Then I ran into a waiter I used to work with and he told me about this old run-down restaurant in an old run-down building in the fish market that was for sale, and I went and saw it, and I took it. The reason I did, Fulton Fish Market reminds me of Recco. There&#x2019;s a world of difference between them. At the same time, they&#x2019;re very much alike&#x2014;the fish smell, the general gone-to-pot look, the trading that goes on in the streets, the roofs over the sidewalks, the cats in corners gnawing on fish heads, the gulls in the gutters, the way everybody&#x2019;s on to everybody else, the quarreling and the arguing. There&#x2019;s a boss fishmonger down here, a spry old hardheaded Italian man who&#x2019;s got a million dollars in the bank and dresses like he&#x2019;s on relief and walks up and down the fish pier snatching fish out of barrels by their heads or their tails and weighing them in his hands and figuring out in his mind to a fraction of a fraction how much they&#x2019;re worth and shouting and singing and enjoying life, and the face on him, the way he conducts himself, he reminds me so much of my father that sometimes, when I see him, it puts me in a good humor, and sometimes it breaks my heart.&#x201d;<br><br>Louie is five feet six, and stocky. He has an owl-like face&#x2014;his nose is hooked, his eyebrows are tufted, and his eyes are large and brown and observant. He is white-haired. His complexion is reddish, and his face and the backs of his hands are speckled with freckles and liver spots. He wears glasses with flesh-colored frames. He is bandy-legged, and he carries his left shoulder lower than his right and walks with a shuffling, hipshot, head-up, old-waiter&#x2019;s walk. He dresses neatly. He has his suits made by a high-priced tailor in the insurance district, which adjoins the fish-market district. Starting work in the morning, he always puts on a fresh apron and a fresh brown linen jacket. He keeps a napkin folded over his left arm even when he is standing behind the cash register. He is a proud man, and somewhat stiff and formal by nature, but he unbends easily and he has great curiosity and he knows how to get along with people. During rush hours, he jokes and laughs with his customers and recommends his daily specials in extravagant terms and listens to fish-market gossip and passes it on; afterward, in repose, having a cup of coffee by himself at a table in the rear, he is grave.</p><h2>Troubleshooter: A Novel</h2><p><p>The maestro of pulse-pounding suspense delivers an explosive new white-knuckle thriller featuring deputy U.S. Marshal Tim Rackley -- a lawman driven by honor, morality, and a thirst for justice.

CHAPTER ONE<p></p> A Quaker from New Jersey<p></p> <br> <br>Alice Paul. Published in 1918.<br><br>November 20, 1907. Birmingham, England. Alice Paul finished dinner with classmates at Woodbrooke, an imposing limestone Georgian estate set in the countryside at almost exactly the center of England. Quakers, like Paul, traveled here from around the world to study social justice and other progressive pursuits. As the servants began clearing the long dining table, Paul excused herself and hastened upstairs to her corner room&#x2014;a shared space with two large windows and a fireplace as its only source of heat&#x2014;to prepare for the night.<br> <br>The fur coat she had begged her mother to ship from the closet in the family farmhouse in Moorestown, New Jersey, in early October had not yet arrived. A perceived extravagance, the fur was a practical staple for the daughter of William Paul, who was a wealthy banker, but contrasted starkly with Paul&#x2019;s student wardrobe, which reflected her necessary thrift as well as a lack of focus on fashion. Her plain clothes were so threadbare that she would fashion a ragged silk dress into a top, as she had just done, rather than throw it away. She bundled up as warmly as she could and did not fuss with jewelry or makeup on her deep-set blue eyes. She grabbed her ticket for the event and walked out into the dark and damp.<br> <br>Gathering up her long, heavy skirt, she mounted a rented bike and began the familiar four-mile pedal into town. It was uncommon for a woman to ride a bike, but Paul was athletic&#x2014;a basketball and hockey player&#x2014;and had been encouraged by her parents since childhood to participate in sports, which girls seldom did. As Quakers, the Pauls believed that all people were equal in the eyes of God, regardless of gender or race; that boys and girls should be given the same opportunities; and that they all had a responsibility to stand up for equality. They believed in justice and fairness and practiced these concepts in their daily lives.<br> <br>Paul rode boldly through the fog to Town Hall in Birmingham. Her chestnut hair&#x2014;parted in the middle and loosely pinned in a bun&#x2014;was swept back in wild strands as she sped toward the industrial city. She was journeying to see two &#x201c;suffragettes,&#x201d; the term for militant activists working for women&#x2019;s right to vote.<br> <br>It was nearly 8 p.m. when Paul parked her bike and made her way through the Town Hall&#x2019;s arched entry. Hundreds of people were inside. Many were male students from the University of Birmingham where Paul was taking classes, in addition to her twelve courses at Woodbrooke. She was the first and only woman enrolled in the university&#x2019;s Department of Commerce. She was fearless around them; unabashed, she strove for what she wanted.<br> <br>Paul had come to listen to a mother-daughter team talk about their Votes for Women campaign. The men at Town Hall, however, had a different agenda, conspiring to undermine these rising leaders of England&#x2019;s suffrage movement. The pair, a widow named Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel, had been making headlines for their tactics: spitting at the police, interrupting the speeches of politicians by shouting &#x201c;Votes for Women!&#x201d; and handing out leaflets on street corners. The men inside Town Hall, like most of their peers, thought granting women the right to vote was outrageous. They believed women belonged at home, their minds uncorrupted by politics, and that these Pankhurst women&#x2014;ringleaders who were whipping up pro-suffrage sentiment all over Britain&#x2014;needed to be silenced.<br> <br>Paul surveyed the room in search of a seat. A crush of students thronged the main floor and the upper galleries overlooking the stage. An organist played in an effort to settle the audience into their seats, however, the music instead stirred the men into action. They began to shake rattles, ring bells, and blow whistles and toy trumpets. This auditory battle between organist and crowd escalated for several minutes until it became so rowdy that four policemen intervened. The Bobbies&#x2019; presence only triggered sarcastic cheers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; the police inspector shouted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Speeeeeech,&#x201d; the men shouted back at him.<br> <br>Unfazed by the chaos, Christabel Pankhurst stepped onto the stage with striking poise. She seemed effortlessly confident; nothing like the newspapers&#x2019; recent reports of an uncouth woman verbally attacking members of Parliament. When Christabel smiled at the surrounding mob, her face was illuminated. Paul could not help but consider her own smile, which revealed dimples and two slightly protruding front teeth. She noted how polished and attractive the twenty-seven-year-old Christabel, just four years her senior, appeared in comparison. The men, however, were not so softened by her affect. They roared at the suffragette for several minutes, waving their hats, sticks, and handkerchiefs provocatively as she patiently endured.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen!&#x201d; Christabel projected over the din. &#x201c;The students of Birmingham gave us on the occasion of our last visit so kind a welcome that I am not surprised to find their enthusiasm for women&#x2019;s suffrage is still unabated.&#x201d;<br> <br>Despite her straining, Paul could not make out Christabel&#x2019;s words and was horrified by the rude antics of the audience. As a child growing up in New Jersey, Paul had attended suffrage meetings with her mother, Tacie Paul, and other Quakers, including men, where everyone agreed unanimously on the issue. She also belonged to a suffrage society, the Moorestown League. Quakers were taught to listen respectfully to others. The intense discord with which Paul was now confronted was both a shock and a thrill.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tit for tat,&#x201d; the students chanted.<br> <br>&#x201c;There seem to be one or two of you in the gallery who are not quite out of the nursery and brought your toys with you,&#x201d; Christabel said. Such acerbic wit would have served her well had she pursued her dream of becoming a lawyer. Unfortunately, the English bar did not accept women, leading Christabel to choose a different path: joining her mother and sisters, Sylvia and Adela, to fight for voting rights.<br> <br>&#x201c;We have come to explain our tactics,&#x201d; Christabel asserted, trying again to pierce the pandemonium.<br> <br>The crowd hushed briefly before someone hurled a dead mouse into the air, causing the hall to erupt in hysteria as the rodent was squeamishly caught and tossed like a hot potato. Christabel called her mother to the stage to take her place. Emmeline obliged as a woman in the audience rose to her feet in defense of the suffragettes, chastising the men: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t interrupt!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We have just come from a meeting with dockworkers and fishermen,&#x201d; Emmeline proclaimed, increasing the volume. They listened. &#x201c;Are the educated young men of Birmingham afraid of what we have to say?&#x201d;<br> <br>A student, wearing glasses and a hat, sounded a bugle. The young woman seated beside him immediately plucked his hat from his head and pelted him with it. In a final act of defiance, he launched the bugle toward the stage as a steward and three policemen descended upon him.<br> <br>Emmeline engaged with the struggle in a diplomatic effort to defuse the situation, reaching to shake the student&#x2019;s hand and assuring him that he could stay if he promised to stop.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, as I was saying . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>The crowd again interrupted, expressing their objection with rattles and horns, bursting into a rendition of the national anthem, &#x201c;God Save the King,&#x201d; as forty more officers flooded into the hall.<br> <br>Paul remained transfixed by Emmeline Pankhurst.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m prepared to stay here all night,&#x201d; Emmeline announced, with her arms outstretched to the audience. &#x201c;If your mothers were here tonight they must blush to think they have borne such creatures.&#x201d;<br> <br>The men, standing on their seats and assaulting their instruments in jarring unison, launched into &#x201c;Auld Lang Syne.&#x201d; Emmeline folded her arms and held her ground for a full hour, determined to be heard. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve played by the constitutional rules for forty years!&#x201d; she shouted. For Emmeline, a little time on this stage, waiting for the crowd to behave, was only a drop of dedication in an ocean of effort.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>British women had been fighting for voting rights for decades. Historically, only men who owned significant amounts of land could vote. By 1868, the government had extended the right to all male heads of household, defined as a working man with at least one child to support. But on both sides of the Atlantic, women were still struggling to make progress.<br> <br>In America, Elizabeth Cady Stanton had organized the first women&#x2019;s rights convention, held in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. Her friend and fellow Quaker suffragist Susan B. Anthony became a household name when, in protest, she attempted to vote in 1872 and was arrested for doing so. The U.S. Constitution did not explicitly grant voting rights to anyone. Instead, it allowed those who could already vote the ability to give or withhold those same rights from anyone else. Those in the pioneering American West were among the first willing to let women cast ballots: Wyoming in 1869 and Utah in 1870, before either was a state; Colorado in 1893; and Idaho in 1896. Internationally, things were more advanced. New Zealand and Australia, for example, allowed women to vote as of 1893 and 1902, respectively. America, despite the efforts of women&#x2019;s suffrage advocates across the nation, was trailing far behind the progress of other countries on the issue. In fact, Paul&#x2019;s mother had worked for suffrage and even brought a young Alice to the Pennsylvania state suffrage convention in 1900.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Now it was 1907. After years of dwindling momentum in England and the United States, the Pankhursts were committed to rallying new women to the cause. That night in Birmingham, they couldn&#x2019;t have known how lucky they were to have the quiet American in their midst. Inspired and disturbed, Paul was riveted, absorbing every moment&#x2014;until her senses were suddenly overwhelmed by the offensive odor of rotten eggs. Someone had released a hydrogen-sulfide stink bomb, creating an atmosphere so foul that the room emptied within seconds. Emmeline left the stage. The organist struck the keys once more, as if leading a church recessional. Paul climbed back on her bicycle and returned to Woodbrooke. She could feel the electricity in her body. It was unlike anything she had felt before.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Later that night, back in her dormitory, Paul felt a profound sense of change. Her environment seemed smaller, beyond the physical sense. Paul recognized that while some of her fellow scholars had enrolled at Woodbrooke in sincere pursuit of knowledge and social education, other students&#x2014;like her American roommate&#x2014;were seeking frivolity. Activities on the estate included tennis and afternoon tea, a ritual enjoyed outside on a sweeping lawn so picturesque it was featured on the postcards available to be sent back home.<br> <br>Paul, a fast talker and faster thinker, had little interest in her roommate&#x2019;s vacant expressions and intellectual idleness&#x2014;or any idleness at all. At age sixteen, Paul had been elected high school valedictorian at a Quaker school in Moorestown, near the gentleman&#x2019;s farm on which she was raised. Later, at Swarthmore College, she had majored in biology; not because she wanted to, but because she felt an obligation to strengthen her understanding of the subject about which she knew least. After graduation, she had completed a yearlong fellowship at a settlement house in lower Manhattan. There, Paul helped people from eastern and central Europe&#x2014;mostly Jews and Italians&#x2014;assimilate to American life at this historic peak of immigration, with 1.3 million people entering the United States as legal residents. She had also helped to form a labor union while she earned another degree, this one in social work, from the New York School of Philanthropy.<br> <br>Paul believed it was her purpose in life to help others and assumed that the best way to achieve this was through social work. But she became disillusioned with this conviction when confronted with the prevailing struggles of citizens all around her, her efforts making little difference. In search of solutions to the injustices she witnessed, Paul returned to school. She was interested in attending Princeton, but the university did not accept women&#x2014;or black men. The school&#x2019;s president, Woodrow Wilson, presided over this exclusion. Instead, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she earned a master&#x2019;s degree in sociology; one of the only women to do so. Her thesis was called &#x201c;Toward Equality.&#x201d;<br> <br>Despite earning three degrees in three years&#x2014;1905, 1906, and 1907&#x2014;her diplomas were not enough to quench Paul&#x2019;s thirst for learning. Her intellectual appetite led her to England and Woodbrooke and inspired a heavy course load, including German, Islam, sociology, and economics. During her stay, Paul realized that she still had much to learn about life beyond academia. As the school year drew to a close, she felt a reluctance to return home, as though her experience was not yet complete. Seeking a new challenge, Paul&#x2019;s instinct was validated when she witnessed a Quaker named Lucy Gardner deliver a lecture at Woodbrooke. Gardner was the leader of the London district Charity Organisation Society, which coordinated social services for the poor. Intrigued by what she had heard, Paul spoke with Gardner, who offered Paul a job as her assistant at the end of the academic year.<br> <br>Paul seized the opportunity and moved into a settlement house in Hoxton, a poor section in East London, living among those she helped. Every moment of every day was infused with some kind of harsh reality: parents burying their children, men and women desperately searching for jobs, people lacking education and opportunity. But, fearless in the face of adversity, Paul proved a natural for the position. She was a formidable taskmaster, assessing three of her aides as incompetent, and a brilliant organizer, who was able to work on little food or rest without complaint. Not long after Paul arrived in Hoxton, a member of the settlement staff&#x2014;a suffragist&#x2014;informed her of two upcoming Votes for Women rallies. More than curious, she chose to attend both.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Paul rode the underground to the first of the two big protests. She emerged at Embankment Station to find herself buffeted by a moody wind and thousands of like-minded people swirling outside on a mid-June day, all of them joining a massive march in support of votes for women. Seeking direction, her eyes fell on an event steward sporting the National Union of Women&#x2019;s Suffrage Societies&#x2019; (NUWSS) red and white colors, which stood out against the gray sky. The leader of the NUWSS, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, was a popular figure, known for refuting the many ridiculous reasons why women should not be permitted to vote. The arguments against suffrage included: that men alone already sufficiently represented women with their best interests in mind; that women were too easily influenced by men, and therefore, their vote would only echo that of the men; that women were so obstinate they might vote differently from their family, creating discord; that domestic life should have one leader, a structure that would be destroyed if women ...</p><h2>Death of a Hollow Man</h2><p>A visit to a Causton Amateur Dramatic Society production is not Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby&#39;s idea of good entertainment, but loyalty to his wife prevails.

By Chuck Swindoll</p><p></p><h2>Out of Silence: Selected Poems</h2><p>Out of Silence: Muriel Rukeyser: Selected Poems edited by Kate Daniels</p><p>During her lifetime, Rukeyser (1913-1980) was sometimes derided for affecting a "period mood," and this collection, based on the 1979 Collected Poems of Muriel Rukeyser , unfortunately reinforces that perception. Even with the early work ("Breathe-in experience, breathe-out poetry"), Rukeyser's poetics were unmediated by self-scrutiny, which would have allowed her to cut self-indulgent language. She has been praised as the strongest poet of her generation to represent the politics of the left, but some of the passages (such as the couplet comparing Plato's rings, Homer's chain of gold and Lenin's "cry of Dare We Win") appear politically naive at this distance from the turbulent times in which they were written. Although there are many fine cadences ("And in my body feel the seasons grow, / Who is it in the dim room? Who is there?"), too often one senses the undertone of the more forceful voices of Jeffers, Eliot and MacLeish, acknowledged influences. Daniels's ( The Niobe Poems ) introduction would have better established a critical framework for Rukeyser's work had she presented a discussion of the poet's technique and a detailed biographical portrait. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Five decades before political correctness became a topic of genteel debate among academics, Rukeyser was raising her poetic voice "to answer the silence of the weak." Her muse demanded that she pay as much attention to the shared, literal world as the world of literature, so, like Whitman, she personalized the public events of her time: the Depression, the Spanish Civil War, the struggles of class and gender ("I hear the singing of the lives of women, / The clear mystery, the offering and pride"). This collection showcases a lifelong effort to deal squarely with large social forces as they rippled through one woman's acute sensibility. Twelve years after her death, the poet's desire to get past "all evasion's wishes" seems no less timely.<br><i>- Fred Muratori, Cornell Univ.

She lives in Ithaca, New York.*Starred Review* Two wordsmiths enthralled by the glimmering pleasures of the life of the mind have lived together in literary camaraderie for decades. So when novelist, memoirist, and critic Paul West was hit with a stroke in 2005 that left his brain scorched and his body battered, both he and his wife, Diane Ackerman, a poet and the lushly original author of such seismic books as The Zookeeper&#x2019;s Wife (2007), had a lot to lose. But West never succumbed to his impaired vision, frozen right hand, or, most remarkably, bewildering and silencing global aphasia; and Ackerman, who by fortuitous prescience had conducted extensive neurological research for her book An Alchemy of Mind (2004), proved to be an ideal caregiver. Writing with her signature empathy, curiosity, brilliance, and mirth, Ackerman chronicles West&#x2019;s heroic battle to reclaim words and mobility and her tailoring of West&#x2019;s speech therapy to match his spectacular vocabulary and unique intelligence. A master of vivid metaphors and multifaceted narratives, Ackerman candidly addresses the profound demands facing caregivers while explaining the cruel consequences of aphasia, charting West&#x2019;s against-all-odds return to conversing and writing (The Shadow Factory, 2008) and marveling over the healing powers of language and intimacy. A gorgeously engrossing, affecting, sweetly funny, and mind-opening love story of crisis, determination, creativity, and repair. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>The Era: 1947-1957 When the Yankees, Giants, and Dodgers Ruled the World</h2><p>A history of baseball&#39;s golden era follows New York&#39;s three teams from 1947 to 1957</p><p>Roger Kahn is widely regarded as one of the greatest sportswriters of all time. He lives in Stone Ridge, New York.An agreeably digressive and anecdotal trip, with a perceptive guide, down a remarkable span in baseball's memory lane. Drawing on experiences gained as a young sportswriter during the post-WW II period he resurrects here, Kahn (Games We Used to Play, The Boys of Summer, etc.) hits the high and low points of nearly a dozen seasons. The author's golden age began with Jackie Robinson's arrival as the first black to play in the major leagues and ended with the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants heading west to California, momentarily making the Yankees the only game in town. In between, the Big Apple's three clubs dominated the national pastime, winning nine out of eleven World Series (as often as not, from one another). During these years, moreover, triborough baseball had an almost perfectly marvelous cast of characters- -including Yogi Berra, Leo Durocher, Whitey Ford, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Walter O'Malley, Pee Wee Reese, Branch Rickey, Red Smith, Duke Snider, and Casey Stengel. In telling detail, Kahn recalls the notable achievements of lesser lights who frequently outdid their superstar teammates in championship contests. Cases in point range from Bobby Thomson's pennant-winning homer through Don Larsen's perfect game and the ninth-inning double by Cooky Lavagetto that broke up a no-hit bid by another Bronx Bomber (Bill Bevens). The author also sets the record straight on what the storied Joe DiMaggio was like off the field; the identity of the player who was Brooklyn's first choice to break baseball's color barrier; Larry MacPhail's alcohol-accelerated retirement; and the impact of the emerging medium of TV on ballpark attendance. While Kahn covers a lot of well-trampled ground here, he does so with an elegant authority that--without false sentiment or excessive nostalgia--puts certain of the diamond game's good old days in clear and compelling perspective.

She&#x2019;d just poured me a cup of tea from her Japanese teapot shaped like a little pumpkin; beyond the kitchen window, two cardinals splashed in her birdbath in the weak Connecticut sunlight. Her white hair was gathered at the nape of her neck, and her voice was low. She put a hand on my arm. &#x201c;Please help me get your father&#x2019;s pacemaker turned off,&#x201d; she said. I met her eyes, and my heart knocked.<br> <br>Directly above us, in what was once my parents&#x2019; shared bedroom, my eighty-five-year-old father, Jeffrey&#x2014;a retired Wesleyan University professor, stroke-shattered, going blind, and suffering from dementia&#x2014;lay sleeping. Sewn into a hump of skin and muscle below his right collarbone was the pacemaker that had helped his heart outlive his brain. As small and shiny as a pocket watch, it had kept his heart beating rhythmically for five years. It blocked one path to a natural death.<br> <br>After tea, I knew, my mother would help my father up from his narrow bed with its mattress encased in waterproof plastic. After taking him to the toilet, she&#x2019;d change his diaper and lead him tottering to the living room, where he&#x2019;d pretend to read a book of short stories by Joyce Carol Oates until the book fell into his lap and he stared out the sliding glass window.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t like describing what the thousand shocks of late old age were doing to my father&#x2014;and indirectly to my mother&#x2014;without telling you first that my parents loved each other and I loved them. That my mother could stain a deck, sew a silk blouse from a photo in Vogue, and make coq au vin with her own chicken stock. That her photographs of Wesleyan authors had been published on book jackets, and her paintings of South African fish in an ichthyologists&#x2019; handbook. That she thought of my father as her best friend.<br> <br>And that my father never gave up easily on anything.<br> <br>Born in South Africa&#x2019;s Great Karoo Desert, he was a twenty-one-year-old soldier in the South African Army when he lost his left arm to a German shell in the Italian hills outside Siena. He went on to marry my mother, earn a PhD from Oxford, coach rugby, build floor-to-ceiling bookcases for our living room, and with my two younger brothers as crew, sail his beloved Rhodes 19 on Long Island Sound. When I was a teenager and often at odds with him, he would sometimes wake me chortling lines from The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam in a high falsetto: &#x201c;Awake, my little one! Before life&#x2019;s liquor in its cup be dry!&#x201d; On weekend afternoons, he would put a record on the stereo and strut around the living room conducting invisible orchestras. At night he would stand in our bedroom doorways and say good night to my two brothers and me quoting Horatio&#x2019;s farewell to the dying Hamlet: &#x201c;May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!&#x201d;<br> <br>Four decades later, in the house where he once chortled and strutted and sometimes thundered, I had to coach him to take off his slippers before he tried to put on his shoes.<br> <br>My mother put down her teacup. She was eighty-three, as lucid and bright as a sword point, and more elegant in her black jeans and thin cashmere sweater than I could ever hope to be. She put her hand, hard, on my arm. &#x201c;He is killing me,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He. Is. Ruining. My. Life.&#x201d; Then she crossed her ankles and put her head between her knees, a remedy for near-fainting that she&#x2019;d clipped from a newspaper column and pinned to the bulletin board behind her. She was taking care of my father for about a hundred hours a week.<br> <br>I looked at her and thought of Anton Chekhov, the writer and physician who died of tuberculosis in 1904 when he was only forty-four. &#x201c;Whenever there is someone in a family who has long been ill, and hopelessly ill,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;there come painful moments when all, timidly, secretly, at the bottom of their hearts long for his death.&#x201d; A century afterward, my mother and I had come to long for the machine in my father&#x2019;s heart to fail.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>How we got there is a long story, but here are a few of the bones. On November 13, 2001, when my father was seventy-nine and apparently vigorous, he suffered a devastating stroke. A year later&#x2014;gravely disabled yet clear-minded enough to know it&#x2014;he was outfitted with a pacemaker in a moment of hurry and hope. The device kept his heart going while doing nothing to prevent his slide into dementia, incontinence, near-muteness, misery, and helplessness. The burden of his care crushed my mother. In January 2007, when my father no longer understood the purpose of a dinner napkin, I learned that his pacemaker could be turned off painlessly and without surgery, thus opening a door to a relatively peaceful death. It was a death I both feared and desired, as I sat at the kitchen table while my mother raised her head from her knees.<br> <br>Her words thrummed inside me: Please help me get your father&#x2019;s pacemaker turned off. I&#x2019;d been hoping for months to hear her say something like this, but now that she&#x2019;d spoken, I was the one with doubts. This was a moral choice for which neither the Anglicanism of my English childhood nor my adopted Buddhism had prepared me. I shook when I imagined watching someone disable his pacemaker&#x2014;and shook even more when I contemplated trying to explain it to him.<br> <br>At the same time, I feared that if I did nothing, his doctors would continue to prolong what was left of my father&#x2019;s life until my mother went down with him. My fear was not unfounded: in the 1980s, while working as a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, I spent six weeks in the intensive care unit of San Francisco General Hospital, watching the erasure of the once-bright line between saving a life and prolonging a dying. I&#x2019;d never forgotten what I saw.<br> <br>If my father got pneumonia, once called &#x201c;the old man&#x2019;s friend&#x201d; for its promise of an easy death, a doctor might well feel duty-bound to prescribe antibiotics. If he collapsed and my mother called 911, paramedics would do everything they could to revive him as they rushed his gurney toward the emergency room.<br> <br>With just a little more bad luck, my father might be wheeled into an intensive care unit, where my mother and I&#x2014;and even my dying father&#x2014;would become bystanders in a battle, fought over the territory of his body, between the ancient reality of death and the technological imperatives of modern medicine. It was not how we wanted him to die, but our wishes might not mean much. Three-quarters of Americans want to die at home, as their ancestors did, but only a quarter of the elderly currently do. Two-fifths of deaths now take place in a hospital, an institution where only the destitute and the homeless died before the dawn of the twentieth century. Most of us say we don&#x2019;t want to die &#x201c;plugged into machines,&#x201d; but a fifth of American deaths now take place in intensive care, where ten days of futile flailing can cost as much as $323,000. If my mother and I did not veer from the pathway my father was traveling, he might well draw his last breath in a room stripped of any reminder of home or of the sacred, among doctors and nurses who knew his blood counts and oxygen levels but barely knew his name.<br> <br>Then again, the hospital might save his life and return him home to suffer yet another final illness. And that I feared almost as much.<br> <br>I loved my father, even as he was: miserable, damaged, and nearly incommunicado. I loved my mother and wanted her to have at least a chance at a happy widowhood. I felt like my father&#x2019;s executioner, and that I had no choice.<br> <br>I met my mother&#x2019;s eyes and said yes.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>I did not know the road we would travel, only that I&#x2019;d made a vow. In the six months that followed, I would learn much about the implications of that vow, about the workings of pacemakers and of human hearts, about law and medicine and guilt, about money and morality. I would take on roles I never imagined could be played by a loving daughter. I would watch my father die laboriously with his pacemaker still ticking. After his death, I would not rest until I understood better why the most advanced medical care on earth, which saved my father&#x2019;s life at least once when he was a young man, succeeded at the end mainly in prolonging his suffering.<br> <br>Researching a magazine article and then this book, I would discover something about the perverse economic incentives within medicine&#x2014;and the ignorance, fear, and hope within our own family&#x2014;that promoted maximum treatment. I would contemplate the unintended consequences of medical technology&#x2019;s frighteningly successful war on natural death and its banishment of the &#x201c;Good Death&#x201d; our ancestors so prized. Armed with that bitter wisdom, I would support my mother when she reclaimed her moral authority, defied her doctors, refused a potentially life-extending surgery, and faced her own death the old-fashioned way: head-on.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>My mother and I often felt like outliers, but I know now that we were not alone. Thanks to a panoply of relatively recent medical advances ranging from antibiotics and vaccines to dialysis, 911 systems, and airport defibrillators, elderly people now survive repeated health crises that once killed them. The &#x201c;oldest old&#x201d; are the nation&#x2019;s most rapidly growing age group. But death is wily. Barred from bursting in like an armed man, it wages a war of attrition. Eyesight dims, joints stiffen, heartbeats slow, veins clog, lungs and bowels give out, muscles wither, kidneys weaken, brains shrink. Half of Americans eighty-five or over need help with at least one practical, life-sustaining activity, such as getting dressed or eating breakfast. Nearly a third have some form of dementia, and more develop it with each year of added longevity. The burden of helping them falls heavily on elderly wives and middle-aged daughters, with the remainder provided by sons and husbands, hired caregivers, assisted living complexes, and nursing homes.<br> <br>Every day across the country, family caregivers find themselves pondering a medical procedure that may save the life&#x2014;or prevent the dying&#x2014;of someone beloved and grown frail. When is it time to say &#x201c;No&#x201d; to a doctor? To say, &#x201c;Enough&#x201d;? The questions surface uneasily in medical journals and chat rooms, in waiting rooms, and in conversations between friends. However comfortingly the questions are phrased, there is no denying that the answers, given or avoided, will shape when and how someone we love meets death. This is a burden not often carried by earlier generations of spouses, sons, and daughters. We are in a labyrinth without a map.<br> <br>Before I shepherded my parents through to their deaths, I thought that medical overtreatment was mainly an economic problem: a quarter of Medicare&#x2019;s roughly $560 billion in annual outlays covers medical care in the last year of life. After my father&#x2019;s death, I understood the human costs. After my mother&#x2019;s death, I saw that there could be another path.<br> <br>In our family&#x2019;s case, the first crucial fork in the road appeared six and a half years before my father died, in the fall of 2001. It began with a family crisis, an invitation to a distant daughter to open her heart, and a seemingly minor medical decision: the proposed installation of a pacemaker in the aftermath of a catastrophic stroke.</p><h2>Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity</h2><p>An ever-increasing proportion of our lives is spent in supermarkets, airports and hotels, on motorways or in front of TVs, computer and cash machines. This invasion of the world by what Marc Auge calls &#x2018;non-space&#x2019; results in a profound alteration of awareness: something we perceive, but only in a partial and incoherent manner. Auge uses the concept of &#x2018;supermodernity&#x2019; to describe the logic of these late-capitalist phenomena&#x2014;a logic of excessive information and excessive space. In this fascinating and lucid essay he seeks to establish and intellectual armature for an anthropology of supermodernity. Starting with an attempt to disentangle anthropology from history, Auge goes on to map the distinction between <i>place</i>, encrusted with historical monuments and creative social life, and <i>non-place</i>, to which individuals are connected in a uniform manner and where no organic social life is possible.<br><br>Unlike Baudelairean modernity, where old and new are interwoven, supermodernity is self-contained: from the motorway or aircraft, local or exotic particularities are presented two-dimensionally as a sort of theme-park spectacle. Auge does not suggest that supermodernity is all-encompassing: place still exist outside non-place and tend to reconstitute themselves inside it. But he argues powerfully that we are in transit through non-place for more and more of our time, as if between immense parentheses, and concludes that this new form of solitude should become the subject of an anthropology of its own.</p><p><b>Marc Aug�</b> is Director of Studies at the Ecole des hautes �tudes en sciences sociales in Paris.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Infinite Variety of Music</h2><p>THE INFINITE VARIETY OF MUSIC by Leonard Bernstein 1966 Hardcover 6 1/2 x 9 1/2 inches, 287 pages Simon and Schuster, NY</p><p></p><h2>The Zahir: A Novel of Obsession</h2><p>The narrator of <em>The Zahir</em> is a bestselling novelist who lives in Paris and enjoys all the privileges money and celebrity bring.

But when he was appointed the chief medical officer for the Army of the Potomac, he revolutionized combat medicine over the course of four major battles&#x2014;Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg&#x2014;that produced unprecedented numbers of casualties. He made battlefield survival possible by creating the first organized ambulance corps and a more effective field hospital system. He imposed medical professionalism on a chaotic battlefield. Where before 20 percent of the men were unfit to fight because of disease, squalid conditions, and poor nutrition, he improved health and combat readiness by pioneering hygiene and diet standards. Based on original research, and with stirring accounts of battle and the struggle to invent and supply adequate care during impossible conditions, this new biography recounts Letterman&#x2019;s life from his small-town Pennsylvania beginnings to his trailblazing wartime years and his subsequent life as a wildcatter and the medical examiner of San Francisco.

His many books include <i>The Persistence of the Old Regime: Europe to the Great War</i>, <i>The Furies: Violence and Terror in the French and Russian Revolutions</i>, <i>Plowshares into Swords: From Zionism to Israel</i> and <i>Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? The &#x201c;Final Solution&#x201d; in History</i>.This sure-to-be-controversial reassessment of Nazism by a Princeton professor of history is certain to provoke, disturb, even outrage. Mayer, himself of European Jewish roots, maintains that "anti-Semitism did not play a decisive or even significant role in the growth of the Nazi movement and electorate." German ultra-nationalism, Social Darwinism and anti-bolshevism were more pivotal elements in the Nazi creed, he asserts. He further claims that the Nazi genocide of six million Jews was not inevitable, and that the Jews became scapegoats marked for annihilation only after Hitler's crusade against the Soviet Union ran aground. With a quick victory over the Red Army, he surmises, the Nazis probably would have deported the Jews en masse to the far interior of Russia. Mayer feels that the Holocaust has become the focus of a sectarian "cult of remembrance"; his stated aim is to restore that horrific tragedy to a historical context. As a corrective to the work of other historians, his massive, detailed study is sometimes challenging, but he overstates his arguments and uses evidence selectively. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>MAR, Vol. 9</h2><p>From Nobuyuki Anzai, creator of &#34;Flame of Recca,&#34; comes the tale of Ginta, a jnior high loser who enters the vivid world of his dreams where, at last, he is a hero!</p><p>Nobuyuki Anzai&#39;s FLAME OF RECCA first appeared in 1995 in the prestigious Japanese magazine Shonen Sunday.

Even though it was her day off, it was going to take everything she had to get through it.<br><br>After a quick shower, she dug out her favorite pair of jeans and an old Washington Redskins T-shirt. It was a relief to wear tennis shoes rather than the leather half boots she often wore to work, but the soles made little squeaking noises on the hardwood floors as she headed for the kitchen. Yet another cheery sound that felt like an irritation.<br><br>A preprogrammed coffeepot had hot coffee waiting. She filled a to-go cup with the hazelnutflavored brew, grabbed her purse and car keys, and headed out the door.<br><br>Next stop was the flower shop. The owner was just opening up, and her stomach rolled as she followed him inside. The smell reminded her of funerals.<br><br>"Give me a couple of minutes to get my register up and running," the salesclerk said.<br><br>"I want to look around, so take your time," Jo said.<br><br>She knew what she needed, but it was going to take her a few minutes to work up the nerve to pick it out and pay without breaking into tears.<br><br>Music began to play somewhere in the back as she moved toward a display of potted mums. Her grandmother had an entire flower bed of chrysanthemums on the east side of her house when Jolene was a girl. Seeing them made her remember a time when she still believed in happy-ever-afters. Now she knew different, and she also knew she couldn't stare at plants all day. Not when she had another appointment to keep. As she moved down the length of the room, she caught sight of a table piled high with stuffed toys and immediately looked away. She wasn't ready for that. Not yet.<br><br>The clerk was at the register now, whistling beneath his breath as he worked. She curled her fingers into fists and lifted her chin as if she was readying for battle.<br><br><em>Focus, Jo. Focus.</em><br><br>She walked to the other side of the room, toward the cooler holding large buckets of cut flowers waiting to be made into arrangements. She saw blue flowers, but they were not the kind she wanted, and she moved on to another display with smaller potted plants. There were colorful pansies with their happy faces, and delicate violets with their green velvet leaves. Then she saw the small pots with the tiny blue flowers, and her eyes filled with tears. Forget-me-nots. Perfect. She sorted through them for a bit and then chose the one with the most blooms.<br><br>To get to the register she had to pass by the display of stuffed animals again, but this time she stopped. It hurt her heart to look at them, but it hurt even more to choose one, knowing where it was going to wind up.<br><br>"Anything I can help you with?" the clerk asked.<br><br>Jo flinched. Some FBI agent she was. He'd walked up beside her and she hadn't even heard him coming.<br><br>"No, thank you. I'm just about done."<br><br>As he walked away, her gaze fell on a small fuzzy giraffe. The first time she'd chosen a toy she'd picked a little teddy bear. Last year she'd chosen a small green turtle. This time it would be the giraffe. She picked it up and headed for the register.<br><br>The man was talking to her as he rang up the purchases, but for the life of her she couldn't remember a thing he'd said. She handed him her credit card and signed the slip he gave her.<br><br>"Would you like to attach a card to the flowers?" he asked.<br><br>"No, thank you," she said again, then picked up her purchases and walked out the door.<br><br>Traffic was heavy as she drove toward North Capitol Street, but it was good to have something to concentrate on.<br><br>Her cell phone rang, but she wouldn't look. Didn't care-couldn't care-when she was on a mission this important. By the time she neared her destination, she began moving into the proper lane so she could exit on a service road to get to the entrance.<br><br>Her heart was hammering so hard when she drove through the entrance to Prospect Hill Cemetery she felt faint. The first time she'd come here she hadn't come alone. Wade had still been with her. But no more. She blinked back tears, refusing to admit most of that was her fault. It had been a subconscious reaction to the guilt she felt, pushing him away instead of letting him in to grieve with her.<br><br>She drove through the cemetery with a heavy heart, found a place to park at the foot of the hill, and got out with her flowers and the toy.<br><br>The sun was warm, but the breeze blowing on the back of her neck kept it from being uncomfortable. As sad as it was to have to come here, it was also a strangely beautiful, peaceful place. She saw an older couple a short distance away, and a woman sitting on a bench farther up the hill-reminders that grieving for the dead was a part of living.<br><br>When she finally reached her destination, the weight in her chest was so heavy it hurt to breathe. Wade had insisted on this plot. He'd said it was because little boys needed trees to climb. She knelt in front of the grave marker to brush away freshly cut grass and a couple of leaves. The stone was cold and hard, the opposite of what you would associate with a baby, but she finally reached out and traced the letters carved into the granite: <em>Samuel Joe Luckett.</em><br><br>The Samuel was for his daddy, Samuel Wade.<br><br>The Joe was for her, his mother, Jolene.<br><br>They had planned to call him Sammy.<br><br>Jo's hands were shaking as she put the flowers against the marker.<br><br>"Happy birthday, little guy. I brought some pretty flowers and a new toy. The flowers are called forget-me-nots. I never forget you, because you're always in my heart, and the toy is called a giraffe. He has a long funny neck, doesn't he? They have some real ones here in the zoo, but this one is about your size."<br><br>Everything began to blur as her voice broke and the tears welled. "If I could take back what happened, I would do it in a heartbeat. I didn't know going to work that day would hurt you or I wouldn't have gone. I know it's my fault you're not here, and I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry."<br><br>Her cell phone rang again, and again she ignored it. She knew who it would be. Even though Wade surely hated her guts, he still called her every year on this day. She couldn't talk to him now. She didn't want him to hear her cry.<br><br>For the past three years Wade Luckett's plan had been to fill up his days with so much work that he wouldn't have to think about what he'd lost. But every year, when this day came around he stepped out of denial, and made himself face what had been the worst day of his life.<br><br>He hadn't slept worth a damn last night and had dressed for work early. The thought of food made him sick, which was a sure sign something was horribly wrong. He drank a cup of coffee while watching the early morning news, and fielded a couple of texts from the office, answered a half-dozen emails, all the while watching the time.<br><br>They opened the gates to the cemetery at sunup, but he wouldn't be the first one there for fear of running into his ex-wife. He still didn't understand how losing their baby had turned her against him. He wasn't the one who shot her, and he damn sure wasn't the one who walked away after it was over. Still, what was past was past. If he could have, he would have gladly died in Sammy's place, but nobody had given him the option.<br><br>For whatever reason, life had kicked them both in the teeth, and today was just the reminder. As soon as he thought enough time had passed, he began gathering up his things. His car keys were in a bowl on the table, and the little yellow Hot Wheels truck he'd picked out at the store last night was right beside them. His hands were shaking when he picked up the truck and dropped it in his pocket. Moments later he was out the door.<br><br>He drove to the cemetery with a painful knot in his chest, and the closer he got, the greater the pain became. He took a deep breath as he drove through the entrance, then kept driving. When he saw a car in the distance and the tall, dark-haired woman kneeling at the grave, his eyes filled with tears.<br><br><em>Ah, damn it, Jolene. You still break my heart.</em><br><br>Unwilling to intrude on her moment, he parked, took the little yellow truck out of his pocket and held it like a talisman against welling pain, but the longer he sat there, the worse the pain became.<br><br>Without thinking, he reached for his phone and called her, just as he did on this day every year. He saw her react as the phone began to ring and knew before she turned around that she wasn't going to answer. He watched as she left the grave and began walking back to her car.<br><br>Her shoulders were too damn straight.<br><br>Her steps were uneven.<br><br>He knew she was crying.<br><br>After she was gone, he drove up and parked beneath the tree near the grave and walked over. When he saw the yellow giraffe, the pain in his chest bloomed. He looked down at the yellow truck he was carrying and shook his head. They'd always been on the same page with everything.<br><br>Then he focused on the name and smiled.<br><br>"Hey, Sammy, it's me, Daddy. I see Mama's already been here. That's a great giraffe you have there. I brought you a birthday present, too. You're three years old today, and I brought you your first Hot Wheels. This one is a little yellow truck like the ones I used to play with when I was three."<br><br>He dropped to his knees, set the truck on the marker next to the giraffe, and then laid the palm of his hand on the engraved name.<br><br>"This is the closest I can get to you here, baby boy, but I carry you in my heart."<br><br>Then he got up and walked away, his shoulders a little too straight, his steps staggering. He couldn't see for the tears in his eyes.<br><br><em>Houston, Texas</em><br><br>Hershel Inman hardly remembered the man he'd been before his wife, Louise, died in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and could barely cope with what he'd become, since Louise wouldn't let him forget it.<br><br>She alternated days of crying and begging him to stop killing with preaching at him for his sins. If he didn't love her so much, and if she wasn't already dead, he would gladly have strangled her just to make her shut up.<br><br>His mission had begun as payback to the authorities who'd come too late to save her, and to<br><br>God for picking and choosing who lived and who died. Then the FBI showed up, and his power grew as he continued to kill and escape detection. He had been invincible-until he'd made that first mistake and missed a survivor who'd witnessed what he'd done. After that, everything began to unwind. He'd tried to silence her, but the FBI kept interfering, and then, to make matters worse, she married the agent who'd saved her.<br><br>Their lives got better and his got worse, ending with the explosion in his getaway boat that nearly killed him. He'd dropped off the radar to let his burns heal and thought about disappearing altogether. But when he closed his eyes at night, all he saw was Louise's face and the fear in her eyes as the water rose higher and higher around them, so he stayed in the wind, waiting for a chance to strike back.<br><br>Spring arrived, bringing with it the chance of tornadoes on a weekly basis through the heartland of America. He knew people would die, but even more would survive, and he thought about starting over with the killings, and wondered if he would be able to contact the FBI team like before. He wondered if they had deactivated the stolen phone he had used to communicate. He told himself if the phone still worked when he recharged it, it meant he was to continue. If it didn't, then he would disappear.<br><br>When it activated, he took it as a sign. He packed his pickup with new camping equipment and headed north out of Houston. Storms were predicted within the next two days. If he got out there ahead of time and set up near where the outbreaks were expected to occur, and if the storms were bad enough, he would be close at hand when the survivors started crawling out of the debris.<br><br>Hershel drove north all the way to Wichita Falls, which was near the Texas-Oklahoma border, found an out-of-the-way place to camp and set up his tent.<br><br>When the storms started building, his anxiety built along with them. As they finally formed into wall clouds and began moving through the countryside, Hershel moved into action.<br><br>"This is it. It's time to party."<br><br>He checked his shoulder pack for Tasers, ropes and leather gloves, tossing them in the front seat of his truck beside the flashlight. He wore dark clothing with a black hooded sweatshirt to hide the side of his face burned in the explosion, and heavy boots for walking through the debris.<br><br>The wind was rising, and the sky was getting dark. It would be sunset within the hour, and the storm would move through the area soon afterward. He got in the truck and started driving north, pacing himself so that he would be coming in behind the weather, and the bigger the storm clouds grew, the more hyped he became.<br><br>According to his radio, the tornado watch had just been upgraded to a tornado warning for Wichita Falls, even as he was nearing the city. A side draft from the powerful storm cell made it difficult to drive, and he finally pulled off the road and parked, unwilling to get any closer until it had moved on. He had the radio tuned to a local weather station with a minute-by-minute update on what was happening. When he heard the frantic announcement that tornadoes were touching down in city neighborhoods, he began planning how he could get into the area before police and rescue sealed it off.<br><br>As soon as the storms began moving away, he drove straight into the chaos they'd left behind and, as he'd hoped, became just another person on the streets trying to help. He'd thought long and hard about how this would play out, leaving bodies with his mark on them. He'd been dreaming about the condition of Louise's body when they finally found her-naked and coming apart at the seams. She would have hated the humiliation, but she was dead, so he hated it for her.<br><br>Rain was still coming down hard as he jumped out of his truck. He shouldered his backpack, grabbed his flashlight and began moving down the street, quickly getting lost among those who were already afoot.<br><br>Some were searching for survivors, while others appeared to have rescued themselves. They were wet, blood-stained and disoriented. Soaked by the downpour and on the lookout for live electrical wires, he kept moving through the area with an eye on his surroundings. At any moment the police or emergency services could show up, and then he would have to move on.<br><br>He saw a trio of men already working to free a couple from under what was left of their home. He wanted no part of that and kept running, dodging downed power lines and using the light from the intermittent lightning flashes to see a broader area than what his flashlight beam showed. Finally he heard what he'd been waiting for: a faint cry for help. He stopped, waiting for the cry again, and when he had a location, he headed into the debris.<br><br>At first he was just moving broken lumber and huge chunks of insulation, then he realized there was a standing wall with a partially attached staircase behind it. He removed a broken commode, cushions from a piece of furniture, broken table lamps and the water-soaked contents of a closet before he finally got to a door. As he dug his way closer, the shouting got louder.<br><br>"I hear you, man. Stay calm," Hershel said, and the man quit shouting. Nothing like having the victim cooperate in his own demise.<br><br>Finally he cleared away enough to see that the man who lived here had taken refuge under ...</p><h2>The Year of Pleasures: A Novel</h2><p>In this rich and deeply satisfying novel by the beloved author of <i>The Art of Mending</i>, and <i>Open House</i>, a resilient woman embarks upon an unforgettable journey of adventure, self-discovery, and renewal.&nbsp; <br><br>Betta Nolan moves to a small town after the death of her husband to try to begin anew.

She lives in Chicago.I had been right to want to drive to the Midwest, taking only the back roads. Every time my husband, John, and I had taken a trip more than a few miles away, we&#x2019;d flown, and had endured the increasingly irritating airport protocols. I&#x2019;d finally begun to wear what amounted to pajamas so that I wouldn&#x2019;t have to all but strip before security guards who seemed either worrisomely bored or, equally worrisome, inflated with a mirthful self-importance. It was hard to believe that air travel had ever been considered glamorous, when now what most people felt was a seesawing between anxiety and exasperation. &#x201c;Well, folks, looks like our time has been pushed back again,&#x201d; the captain would say, and everyone would shake their heads and snap their newspapers and mutter to their neighbor. And if there was unexpected turbulence, a quivering silence fell.<br><br>Now, on this road trip, my mind seemed to uncrinkle, to breathe, to present to itself a cure for a disease it had not, until now, known it had. Rather than the back of an airline seat or endless, identical rest stops on the interstate, I saw farmhouses in the middle of protective stands of trees, silos reaching for the sky, barns faded to the soft red of tomato soup. The weather everywhere stayed stubbornly warm, and people seemed edgily grateful&#x2014;what could this mean, sixty-degree weather in November? I drove through one small town where old people sat on rockers on front porches and kids tore around corners on bikes and young mothers, jackets tied around their waists, proudly pushed babies in strollers.<br><br>I passed white wooden churches, red brick schools, stores with names familiar only to the locals, and movie theaters offering a single choice. I saw cats stationed at living room windows, horses switching tails against clouds of gnats, cows in pastures grouped together like gossips. These scenes seemed imbued with a beauty richer than normal; they seemed so perfect as to have been staged. I felt as though I were driving through a museum full of pastoral bas-reliefs, and I took in the details that way, with wonder and appreciation. That was the tolerable part of my new vulnerability, the positive side of feeling my heart had migrated out of my body to hang on my chest like a necklace.<br><br>There was an infinite variety of trees, and I felt ashamed to know the names of so few of them. John and I used to talk about how the current phase of the moon as well as the names of trees and flowers and birds&#x2014;at least the local ones!&#x2014;should be front and center in people&#x2019;s brains; maybe such a connection to nature would help to make us more civilized. But I was as guilty as anyone; the only tree I knew beyond pines and willows and birches was the black locust, and that was because I liked the way John had described the blossoms&#x2019; scent: like grape lollipops. I passed massive-trunked trees standing powerful and alone, and imagined how in summer their leafy canopy would provide a gigantic circle of shade. I passed a group of reedy saplings bending like ballerinas in the wind. Willow trees dipped their bare branches into pond water like girls testing the temperature with their toes.<br><br>I felt a low and distinct kind of relaxation. Time became real. Nature became real: the woods, the sky, the lakes, the high bluffs and low valleys, the acres of spent fields, the muddy riverbanks. Live photos flashed before me: Here, a construction worker eating a sandwich, one foot up on the bumper of his truck. Here, a woman in curlers loading groceries into her car. Here, a child glimpsed through a kitchen window, standing on a stool to reach into a cupboard; there, a beauty operator giving an old lady a perm.<br><br>I saw in a way I never had before the beauty and diversity of our earnest labor on the earth, and also our ultimate separateness. This helped my pain metamorphose into something less personal and more universal, something organic and natural. And that helped give me strength. Someone had to die first. It turned out to be John. Nothing more. Nothing less. What fell to me now, what I was driving toward, was the creation of a new kind of life, minus the ongoing influence of what I had loved and depended upon most in the world. In a way, my situation reminded me of a little girl I&#x2019;d once seen exiting a roller coaster at a state fair, all wide eyes and pale face and shaky knees. When her brother asked if she&#x2019;d like to ride again, she said, &#x201c;Not until I&#x2019;m way readier.&#x201d; I felt myself trapped in line for a ride I was not nearly ready for, looking back but moving forward in the only direction I could go.<br><br>Mile by mile, the country unfurled before me&#x2014;in bright morning light, throughout golden afternoons, under the pastel-colored skies of evenings. Once, just outside of Cleveland, when the sky was lavender and the clouds pink, I pulled to the side of the freeway to watch until darkness smudged the colors into night. Land rushed up, then fell away; rushed up, then fell away. I became intimately aware of the lay of the land, felt the rise and fall of it in my stomach as I drove up and down steep hills. I deliberately pushed everything out of my head but what was before me. Still, every now and then a quick thrill raced up my spine in the form of a thought: I am my own again. Sorrow that lay pooled inside me gave over to a kind of exhilaration in those moments; the relief was stunning.<br><br>Though impermanent. One night, I checked into a motel at around ten o&#x2019;clock. Next door, I heard a couple making love. Their sounds were sloppy and slightly hysterical&#x2014;Drunk, I thought. I turned the radio up loud, ran a bath, and while sitting at the edge of the tub unwrapping the absurdly little bar of soap, I felt the weight of my loss move slowly back into me. After I dried off, I sat before the television and marveled at the drivel that passed for entertainment. I turned it off, finally, then sat at the side of the bed and stared out at nothing. I picked up the telephone and dialed my home number. I heard the characteristic tones, then, The number you have reached has been disconnected. I hung up, closed my eyes, and took in a deep breath. Then I knelt at the side of the bed and pushed my face into my hands.<br>Late in the afternoon of the third day, I pulled over to a frozen-yogurt stand near the center of a small town that looked particularly attractive to me. A tall, early-thirtyish man waited on me. He was beginning to bald already and had a distressing complexion. But his eyes, as though in compensation, were a brilliant blue. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be a dollar sixty-five,&#x201d; he said, handing me the raspberry cone I&#x2019;d ordered. I pulled two dollars from my wallet and handed them to him, then took a lick of the yogurt. &#x201c;Delicious,&#x201d; I said, and smiled at him. He smiled back, hesitantly, then fussed with the register for a long while as I watched, first in mild annoyance, then in sympathy, finally in utter fascination. Eventually, the man turned and called to someone in the back room. &#x201c;Louise?&#x201d; he said, apparently too softly, for then he called a bit louder, &#x201c;Louise?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;WHAT?&#x201d; she yelled back.<br><br>The man straightened the paper hat on his head. &#x201c;Could you come out and help me?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Please?&#x201d;<br><br>Louise came out to the cash register, scowling. She was wearing a maroon sweat suit and was massively overweight. She wore her hair in a high ponytail. It was beautiful hair, thick and auburn-colored; I concentrated on it while she concentrated on me. Finally, I looked at her face. &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>She jutted her chin at me. &#x201c;How you doing.&#x201d; There was mischief in her eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Was that you yelling back there?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>She grinned. &#x201c;Yeah, that was me, whistling while I work.&#x201d; She jerked her head toward the man. &#x201c;This goes on all the livelong day.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, well,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Easy for you to say.&#x201d; She turned to glare at the man, who studied his shoes. Then she fixed the register and stomped off.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay!&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;Says here I owe you thirty-five cents!&#x201d; He handed me the change.<br><br>I thanked him, then, laughing, said, &#x201c;Though I think you could have figured that out on your own.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked doubtful.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, come on,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think we&#x2019;re getting way too dependent on these damn machines?&#x201d;<br><br>Now he looked grateful. &#x201c;Idn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>I thanked him again and headed for the door. But I turned back before I opened it. &#x201c;Could you tell me what town this is?&#x201d;<br><br>He pointed to the floor. &#x201c;This here town where we&#x2019;re at now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>He straightened, made himself taller. &#x201c;This is Stewart, Illinois, and I&#x2019;ll tell you what, it&#x2019;s only forty-nine miles from Chicago. Exactamento. I been here my whole life. It&#x2019;s a good town, Stewart. Is this what you&#x2019;re looking for?&#x201d;<br><br>I hesitated, then answered, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>As I started to open the door again, I heard him clear his throat and say, &#x201c;Miss?&#x201d;<br><br>I turned back. He was blushing, but with a kind of borrowed confidence, he said, &#x201c;Would you like to be on my radio show?&#x201d;<br><br>I tried hard not to let my astonishment show. &#x201c;You have a radio show?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am, Talk of the Town. I get guests from town on, and we talk. That&#x2019;s the show.&#x201d;<br><br>I thought of the empty miles I&#x2019;d driven through to get to this town, the few places of business I&#x2019;d seen thus far. I didn&#x2019;t recall anything that looked like it might be&#x2014;or house&#x2014;a broadcasting studio. &#x201c;Where?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Right at WMRZ a few blocks over. It&#x2019;s above the drugstore. I&#x2019;ve had Louise on my show&#x2014;we talked about yogurt: Wh...</p><h2>Imperial Masquerade</h2><p>Essays discuss journalism, the publishing industry, the arts, fame, violence, politics, the Reagan administration, and Oliver North</p><p>Here is a book that a reader may dip into without having to take a plunge. It consists of 70 essays that Lapham, author of Money and Class in America ( LJ 1/88), editor of Harper's Magazine, and host of the TV series Bookmark , wrote between 1980 and 1989. Most of the selections appeared in Harper's and the remainder in such newspapers as The Washington Post and The Baltimore Sun . It is a ships-and-shoes-and-sealing wax affair in which the editor-philosopher displays an agile, wide-ranging mind and an easy, free-flowing style. He writes about everything--arts and letters, politics and economics, states and government. A great deal of the talk is witty and lighthearted, several of the anecdotes are delightful, and there is much satire, both kindly and biting. But there is also an element of intellectual idealism that gives depth of a kind to the general riot. A solid purchase. For more on Lapham, see "Contributing Factors," p. 93.<br><i>- Ed. -- A.J. Anderson, Graduate Sch. of Library &amp; Information Science, Simmons Coll., Boston</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Lapham ( Money and Class in America ) sees signs of decadence everywhere, from domestication of the arts through government subsidies to our awe of anything that smacks of "high tech." In this miscellany of 50 Harper's columns and 20 other pieces, the editor of Harper's lashes out at the subservient U.S. press, crippled watchdog of the powers that be, and questions America's assumptions of unlimited virtue and power. He skewers Jimmy Carter, Oliver North, "competent despot" Anwar Sadat, Geraldine Ferraro and, above all, "illusionist" Ronald Reagan. He critiques the insanity of nuclear arms buildup, the CIA's "comedy of errors" abroad, U.S. foreign loans that trap poorer nations in a spiral of debt. Lapham's patrician tone is at odds with his anti-establishment opinions, and one often wishes for a more sustained, thoroughgoing analysis of the issues he raises. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Carpet People</h2><p><i>In the beginning, there was nothing but endless flatness.

Do you think you could have kept us in the Carpet for anything like forty books?</strong></p> <p><strong>Terry Pratchett:</strong> I was about to say, &#x201c;No,&#x201d; but right now I wonder. . . . If the idea had taken, I don&#x2019;t know. I really don&#x2019;t. But how would it be? People in the Carpet are more or less tribal. What would happen if I . . . You&#x2019;ve got me thinking!</p> <p><strong>CD: You took a bunch of runs at building a world where a million stories could unfold&#x2014;The Carpet People, Truckers, and, finally, Discworld. Is Discworld&#x2019;s near-total untethering from our world the secret of its staying power?</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> It isn&#x2019;t our world, but on the other hand it is very much <em>like</em> our world. Discworld takes something from this world all the time, shows you bits of the familiar world in new light by putting them into Discworld.</p> <p><strong>CD: You write a lot of feudal scenarios, but you also seem like a fellow with a lot of sympathy for (and suspicion of!) majority rule. The Carpet People is shot through with themes of who should rule and why. Where does legitimate authority spring from?</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> The people! The only trouble is the people can be a bit stupid&#x2014;I know that; I&#x2019;m one of the people, and I&#x2019;m quite stupid.</p> <p><strong>CD: What should the writer&#x2019;s relationship with authority be?</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> My personal view is that you look askance at authority. Authority must be challenged at every step. You challenge authority to keep it on its toes.</p> <p><strong>CD: <em>The Carpet People</em> concerns itself with many questions of infrastructure and public works. Now that we&#x2019;ve arrived at a time of deep austerity, what do you think the future of infrastructure is?</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> To crack and fall away, I sometimes think. From what I see around me, it&#x2019;s people doing it for themselves. We know the government is there, but we know they have no real power to do anything but mess things up, so you do workarounds.</p> <p><strong>CD: Ultimately, it comes down to the builders, the wreckers, and the free spirits.</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> Sometimes things need tearing down&#x2014;and that might be, as it were, the gates of the city. But if we talk without metaphors, I would say that building is best. Because it is inherently useful. My dad was a mechanic; maybe it starts there. </p> <p><strong>One thing I&#x2019;ve always enjoyed about your books with feudal settings is that it seems you get something like the correct ratio of vassals to lords. So much of fantasy seems very top-heavy. Do you consciously think about political and economic considerations when you&#x2019;re devising a world?</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> I&#x2019;ve never been at home with lords and ladies, kings, and rubbish like that, because it&#x2019;s not so much fun. Take a protagonist from the bottom of the heap and they&#x2019;ve got it all to play for. Whereas people in high places, all they can do is, well . . . I don&#x2019;t know, actually: I&#x2019;ve never been that high. If you have the underdog in front of you, that means you&#x2019;re going to have fun, because what the underdog is going to want to do is be the upper dog or be no dog at all.</p> <p><strong>CD: Damon Knight once told me that he thought that no matter how good a writer you are, you probably won&#x2019;t have anything much to say until you&#x2019;re about twenty-six (I was twenty at the time). You&#x2019;ve written about collaborating with your younger self on the revised text of <em>The Carpet People</em>. Do you feel like seventeen-year-old Terry had much to say?</strong></p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> That&#x2019;s the best question you&#x2019;ve asked all day! I think that he had a go at it, and it wasn&#x2019;t bad, but that when I was younger I didn&#x2019;t have the anger. It gives an outlook. And a place from which to stand. When you get out of the teens, <em>well</em> out of the teens, you begin to have some kind of understanding: you&#x2019;ve met so many people, heard so many things, all the bits that growing up means. And out of that lot comes wisdom&#x2014;it might not be very good wisdom to start with, but it will be a certain kind of wisdom. It leads to better books.</p>Sir Terry Pratchett, the author of more than three dozen novels, is one of the world's best-selling and best-loved novelists writing in the English language.

She was the first author to be inducted into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame. As of 2011, her novels had spent a combined 861 weeks on the <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller List, including 176 weeks in the number-one spot. Over 280 million copies of her books are in print, including 12 million copies sold in 2005 alone.</p><p>"Watch your step, please. Please, watch your step. Thank you." Liz took a ticket from a sunburned man with palm trees on his shirt, then waited patiently for a woman with two bulging straw baskets to dig out another one.</p> <p>"I hope you haven't lost it, Mabel. I told you to let me hold it."</p> <p>"I haven't lost it," the woman said testily before she pulled out the little piece of blue cardboard.</p> <p>"Thank you. Please take your seats." It was several more minutes before everyone was settled and she could take her own. "Welcome aboard the<i> Fantasy,</i> ladies and gentlemen."</p> <p>With her mind on a half dozen other things, Liz began her opening monologue. She gave an absentminded nod to the man on the dock who cast off the ropes before she started the engine. Her voice was pleasant and easy as she took another look at her watch. They were already fifteen minutes behind schedule. She gave one last scan of the beach, skimming by lounge chairs, over bodies already stretched and oiled slick, like offerings to the sun. She couldn't hold the tour any longer.</p> <p>The boat swayed a bit as she backed it from the dock and took an eastern course. Though her thoughts were scattered, she made the turn from the coast expertly. She could have navigated the boat with her eyes closed. The air that ruffled around her face was soft and already warming, though the hour was early. Harmless and powder-puff white clouds dotted the horizon. The water, churned by the engine, was as blue as the guidebooks promised. Even after ten years, Liz took none of it for granted&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;especially her livelihood. Part of that depended on an atmosphere that made muscles relax and problems disappear.</p> <p>Behind her in the long, bullet-shaped craft were eighteen people seated on padded benches. They were already murmuring about the fish and formations they saw through the glass bottom. She doubted if any of them thought of the worries they'd left behind at home.</p> <p>"We'll be passing Paraiso Reef North," Liz began in a low, flowing voice. "Diving depths range from thirty to fifty feet. Visibility is excellent, so you'll be able to see star and brain corals, sea fans and sponges, as well as schools of sergeant majors, groupers and parrot fish. The grouper isn't one of your prettier fish, but it's versatile. They're all born female and produce eggs before they change sex and become functioning males."</p> <p>Liz set her course and kept the speed steady. She went on to describe the elegantly colored angelfish, the shy, silvery smallmouth grunts, and the intriguing and dangerous sea urchin. Her clients would find the information useful when she stopped for two hours of snorkeling at Palancar Reef.</p> <p>She'd made the run before, too many times to count. It might have become routine, but it was never monotonous. She felt now, as she always did, the freedom of open water, blue sky and the hum of engine with her at the controls. The boat was hers, as were three others, and the little concrete block dive shop close to shore. She'd worked for all of it, sweating through months when the bills were steep and the cash flow slight. She'd made it. Ten years of struggle had been a small price to pay for having something of her own. Turning her back on her country, leaving behind the familiar, had been a small price to pay for peace of mind.</p> <p>The tiny, rustic island of Cozumel in the Mexican Caribbean promoted peace of mind. It was her home now, the only one that mattered. She was accepted there, respected. No one on the island knew of the humiliation and pain she'd gone through before she'd fled to Mexico. Liz rarely thought of it, though she had a vivid reminder.</p> <p>Faith. Just the thought of her daughter made her smile. Faith was small and bright and precious, and so far away. Just six weeks, Liz thought, and she'd be home from school for the summer.</p> <p>Sending her to Houston to her grandparents had been for the best, Liz reminded herself whenever the ache of loneliness became acute. Faith's education was more important than a mother's needs. Liz had worked, gambled, struggled so that Faith could have everything she was entitled to, everything she would have had if her father...</p> <p>Determined, Liz set her mind on other things. She'd promised herself a decade before that she would cut Faith's father from her mind, just as he had cut her from his life. It had been a mistake, one made in nai�vet� and passion, one that had changed the course of her life forever. But she'd won something precious from it: Faith.</p> <p>"Below, you see the wreck of a forty-passenger Convair airliner lying upside down." She slowed the boat so that her passengers could examine the wreck and the divers out for early explorations. Bubbles rose from air tanks like small silver disks. "The wreck's no tragedy," she continued. "It was sunk for a scene in a movie and provides divers with easy entertainment."</p> <p>Her job was to do the same for her passengers, she reminded herself. It was simple enough when she had a mate on board. Alone, she had to captain the boat, keep up the light, informative banter, deal with snorkel equipment, serve lunch and count heads. It just hadn't been possible to wait any longer for Jerry.</p> <p>She muttered to herself a bit as she increased speed. It wasn't so much that she minded the extra work, but she felt her paying customers were entitled to the best she could offer. She should have known better than to depend on him. She could have easily arranged for someone else to come along. As it was, she had two men on the dive boat and two more in the shop. Because her second dive boat was due to launch at noon, no one could be spared to mate the glass bottom on a day trip. And Jerry had come through before, she reminded herself. With him on board, the women passengers were so charmed that Liz didn't think they even noticed the watery world the boat passed over.</p> <p>Who could blame them? she thought with a half smile. If she hadn't been immune to men in general, Jerry might have had her falling over her own feet. Most women had a difficult time resisting dark, cocky looks, a cleft chin and smoky gray eyes. Add to that a lean, muscular build and a glib tongue, and no female was safe.</p> <p>But that hadn't been why Liz had agreed to rent him a room, or give him a part-time job. She'd needed the extra income, as well as the extra help, and she was shrewd enough to recognize an operator when she saw one. Previous experience had taught her that it made good business sense to have an operator on your side. She told herself he'd better have a good excuse for leaving her without a crew, then forgot him.</p> <p>The ride, the sun, the breeze relaxed her. Liz continued to speak of the sea life below, twining facts she'd learned while studying marine biology in college with facts she'd learned firsthand in the waters of the Mexican Caribbean. Occasionally one of her passengers would ask a question or call out in excitement over something that skimmed beneath them. She answered, commented and instructed while keeping the flow light. Because three of her passengers were Mexican, she repeated all her information in Spanish. Because there were several children on board, she made certain the facts were fun.</p> <p>If things had been different, she would have been a teacher. Liz had long since pushed that early dream from her mind, telling herself she was more suited to the business world. Her business world. She glanced over where the clouds floated lazily over the horizon. The sun danced white and sharp on the surface of blue water. Below, coral rose like castles or waved like fans. Yes, she'd chosen her world and had no regrets.</p> <p>When a woman screamed behind her, Liz let off the throttle. Before she could turn, the scream was joined by another. Her first thought was that perhaps they'd seen one of the sharks that occasionally visited the reefs. Set to calm and soothe, Liz let the boat drift in the current. A woman was weeping in her husband's arms, another held her child's face protectively against her shoulder. The rest were staring down through the clear glass. Liz took off her sunglasses as she walked down the two steps into the cabin.</p> <p>"Please try to stay calm. I promise you, there's nothing down there that can hurt you in here."</p> <p>A man with a Nikon around his neck and an orange sun visor over a balding dome gave her a steady look.</p> <p>"Miss, you'd better radio the police."</p> <p>Liz looked down through the clear glass, through the crystal blue water. Her heart rose to her throat. She saw now why Jerry had stood her up. He was lying on the white sandy bottom with an anchor chain wrapped around his chest.</p> <p>The moment the plane finished its taxi, Jonas gathered his garment bag and waited impatiently for the door to be opened. When it did, there was a whoosh of hot air and the drone of engines. With a quick nod to the flight attendant he strode down the steep metal stairs. He didn't have the time or the inclination to appreciate the palm trees, the bursts of flowers or the dreamy blue sky. He walked purposefully, eyes straight ahead and narrowed against the sun. In his dark suit and trim tie he could have been a businessman, one who'd come to Cozumel to work, not to play. Whatever grief, whatever anger he felt were carefully masked by a calm, unapproachable expression.</p> <p>The terminal was small and noisy. Americans on vacation stood in groups laughing or wandered in confusion. Though he knew no Spanish, Jonas passed quickly through customs then into a small, hot alcove where men waited at podiums to rent cars and Jeeps. Fifteen minutes after landing, Jonas was backing a compact out of a parking space and heading toward town with a map stuck in the sun visor. The heat baked right through the wind-shield.</p></p><h2>The Egyptian Jukebox: A Conundrum</h2><p>Containing a baffling mystery that reveals a connection between the ancient and contemporary worlds, an adult picture book offers a ten-drawer &#34;cabinet&#34; of colorful artifacts, each with its own eerie story. 75,000 first printing. $75,000 ad/promo.</p><p></p><h2>Death Blossoms: Reflections from a Prisoner of Conscience</h2><p>When Mumia Abu-Jamal&#39;s first book, Live from Death Row, appeared in 1995, its searing indictment of racism and political bias in our judicial system fueled nationwide controversy. Now in this new collection of short vignettes and reflections, he examines the deeper dimensions of existence. The result is a powerful testament to the invincibility of the human spirit.</p><p>Mumia Abu-Jamal, an award-winning journalist, is America&#39;s best-known political prisoner. Sentenced with execution, Mumia has lived on Death Row since 1982. Ever since he wrote for the Black Panther Party&#39;s national newspaper as a youth, Mumia has reported on the racism and inequity in our society. He soon added radio to his portfolio, eventually recording a series of reports from death row for NPR&#39;s All Things Considered. However, NPR, caving in to political pressure, refused to air the programs. Mumia Abu-Jamal is still fighting for his own freedom from prison, and through his powerful voice, for the freedom of all people from inequity.Abu-Jamal has been on death row for 15 years for a crime many believe he did not commit. A well-respected African American journalist, Abu-Jamal followed a lifelong quest for meaning and enlightenment, which inspired him to join the Black Panther Party as a young man and later John Africa's community, MOVE, alignments that put him in clear opposition to the powers-that-be, a stance he firmly retains. Refusing to be silenced by his incarceration and impending execution, Abu-Jamal has defied the authorities to write <i>Live from Death Row</i> (1995), which has sold 80,000 copies, and now this collection of vigorous social critiques and moving essays on matters of faith. Like so many other oppressed writers-of-conscience, Abu-Jamal has been rewarded for suffering the torment of exile and isolation, vilification and a sentence of death with the grace of a genuine spiritual awakening, and the flame of his keen intellect and irrepressible soul burns brightly, illuminating each mind that opens to his wise words. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Gentle Tamers: Women of the Old Wild West</h2><p>All aspects of western feminine life, which include a good deal about the western male, are covered in this lively, informal but soundly factual account of the women who built the West.

Equally important, he shows how historical narratives have helped sustain notions of America's national purpose and policy, many of which were first articulated in 1898. Cuba insinuated itself into one of the most important chapters of U.S. history, and what happened on the island in the final decade of the nineteenth century--and the way in which what happened was subsequently represented--has had far-reaching implications, many of which continue to resonate today.<br><br></p></p><p>"Perez has hit on the soft underbelly of U.S. policy in 1898, which U.S. historians have often tended to repress."-- <i>New York Review of Books</i> <br>Focusing on the War of 1898, Louis Perez presents both a critique of the conventional historiography and an alternate history of the war that is informed by Cuban sources.</p><h2>The photographs of Margaret Bourke-White</h2><p>hardcover with dust jacket</p><p></p><h2>Witchcraft for Tomorrow</h2><p>Since the publication of her previous books on witchcraft, Doreen Valiente has received many letters asking -How can I find a witches' coven? How can I become a witch?- This book gives the answers. <p>It tells you what the old religion of witchcraft has to offer the new age; how the ago-old Craft of the Wise can be practiced in the modern world; how to initiate yourself and start your own coven. The author has been a practicing witch since 1953, and in this book she gives a new Book of Shadows (the witch's handbook of rituals and instructions) based upon ancient magical tradition but geared to present times. Included are spells, incantations, witch songs, and practical advice on how to run a coven and how to acquire your own collection of magical implements.</p></p><p>Doreen Valiente (1922&#x2013;1999)&nbsp;was one of the founders of modern Wicca and was initiated into four different branches of the Old Religion.

But more than two million women bought the book and hailed her as a heroine. Brown was also pilloried as a scarlet woman and a traitor to the women&#39;s movement when she took over the failing Hearst magazine Cosmopolitan and turned it into a fizzy pink guidebook for &#34;do-me&#34; feminism. As the first magazine geared to the rising wave of single working women, it sold wildly. Today, more than 68 million young women worldwide are still reading some form of Helen Gurley Brown&#39;s audacious yet comforting brand of self-help. &#34;HGB&#34; wasn&#39;t the ideal poster girl for secondwave feminism, but she certainly started the conversation. Brown campaigned for women&#39;s reproductive freedom and advocated skill and &#34;brazenry&#34; both on the job and in the boudoir_along with serial plastic surgery. When she died in 2012, her front-page obituary in The New York Times noted that though she succumbed at ninety, &#34;parts of her were considerably younger.&#34; Her life story is astonishing, from her roots in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas, to her single-girl decade as a Mad Men-era copywriter in Los Angeles, which informed her first bestseller, to her years at the helm of Cosmopolitan. Helen Gurley Brown told her own story many times, but coyly, with plenty of camouflage. Here, for the first time, is the unvarnished and decoded truth about &#34;how she did it&#34;_from her comet-like career to &#34;bagging&#34; her husband of half a century, the movie producer David Brown.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2016:</strong>It reads like the plot of a B-movie from the 1950s. Plain girl from a poor Midwestern family, scarred by the horrific accident that killed her beloved father, grows up to be a hot-shot, trailblazing New York executive, marries a movie mogul and rules the world. But if those are the bare outlines of the life story of the late Helen Gurley Brown, groundbreaking editor of <em>Cosmopolitan</em> magazine, Gerri Hirshey&#x2019;s brilliantly journalistic biography of Brown adds nuance and subtlety and cultural history; Hirshey&#x2019;s <em>Not Pretty Enough</em> (the description that dogged poor Helen all her life) treats Brown &#x2013; who seemed to some nothing more than a courtesan-in-training for rich and important men &#x2013; very seriously as a feminist and a cultural force. A working woman before those words were a clich�, an unabashed believer in women&#x2019;s rights to their sexual desires, and an all-around tough businesswoman who took care of her ailing mother and sister long after she&#x2019;d left them far behind, the Helen Gurley Brown who emerges here is both an anachronism and a trailblazer all at once.

Emily feels a connection&nbsp;to the young woman and is determined to bring the killer to justice.</p><p>Pursuing a trail of clues and victims to the beautiful medieval city of Rouen and a crumbling chateau in the country, Emily begins to worry about her own sanity: she hears the cries of a little girl she cannot find and discovers blue ribbons left in&nbsp;the child's wake. As Emily is forced to match wits with a brilliant and manipulative killer, only her courage, keen instincts and formidable will to win can help her escape becoming his next victim.</p></p><p>The daughter of two philosophy professors, I grew up surrounded by books. I was convinced from an early age that I was born in the wrong century and spent much of my childhood under the dining room table pretending it was a covered wagon. Even there, I was never without a book in hand and loved reading and history more than anything. I studied English Literature and Medieval History at the University of Notre Dame. Writing is a natural offshoot of reading, and my first novel,&nbsp;<i>And Only to Deceive</i>, was published in 2005. I'm the New York Times Bestselling author of the long-running Lady Emily Series as well as the novel&nbsp;<i>Elizabeth: The Golden Age</i>. One of the best parts of being an author is seeing your books translated, and I'm currently in love with the Japanese editions of the Emily books.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I played nomad for a long time, living in Indiana, Amsterdam, London, Wyoming, Vermont, Connecticut, and Tennessee before settling down. My husband, the brilliant British novelist&nbsp;Andrew Grant&nbsp;(I may be biased but that doesn't mean I'm wrong) and I now divide our time between Chicago and Wyoming. He makes sure I get my English characters right, and I make sure his American ones sound American.DANGEROUS TO KNOW (Chapter 1) <p>Although a stranger to the Norman countryside, even I knew a dark pool of blood under a tree was not something a tourist should expect to see during an afternoon ride. Sliding down from the saddle, I put a calming hand on my horse&#x2019;s neck, then bent to investigate more closely. Had I been able to convince myself the congealing liquid was something less nefarious, the sight of a pale hand, blue fingertips extended, would have changed my mind at once. Without stopping to think, I rubbed my abdomen, the remnants of dull pain still present after my own encounter with violence, and took a step towards the body.</p><p>Only a few months ago, during what was meant to be a blissful honeymoon, I&#x2019;d been trapped in a cavernous cistern deep below the city of Constantinople with the villain who shot me in an attempt to keep quiet my discovery that he was guilty of murder. His efforts were, of course, in vain. But although I succeeded in exposing the odious man and saving the life of the sultan&#x2019;s concubine whom he&#x2019;d held as a hostage, I&#x2019;d lost something more dear. I did not know when I stepped into the gloomy bowels of the city that I was with child. Now, instead of preparing for an heir, my husband and I were no longer sure we could ever have one.</p><p>Colin Hargreaves was not a man to be daunted, even in the face of such tragedy. He insisted that nothing mattered but my recovery and packed me off to France the moment I was well enough to travel. His intentions were the best. His choice of location, however, fell something short of perfection. Not Normandy itself&#x2014;the lush countryside was stunning, the rich, cream-laden food magnificent&#x2014;but our lodgings at his mother&#x2019;s house left something to be desired. Although that, too, is not entirely precise. There was nothing wrong with the manor, a sprawling, comfortable building constructed primarily in the seventeenth century by an aristocrat whose descendents did not fare well during the revolution. Rather, it was I who was the problem. At least so far as my new mother-in-law was concerned.</p><p>I&#x2019;d heard nothing but complimentary words about Mrs. Hargreaves, who had fled England after the death of her husband some ten years before. Her own father had been left a widower early, and encouraged his daughter to remain at home&#x2014;not to take care of him, but because he, not much fond of society, felt she should be allowed to lead whatever sort of life she liked. His fortune ensured she would never need a husband for support. Free from the restraints of matrimony, Anne Howard passed nearly twenty years traveling the world while her girlhood friends married and had children. It was only when she reached her thirty-sixth year that, halfway up the Great Pyramid at Giza, she met Nicholas Hargreaves. By the time they were standing again on terra firma, the couple were engaged. Three days later they married, and afterwards, never spent a single night apart.</p><p>I had hoped Mrs. Hargreaves would shower me with the warmth she showed her son&#x2014;that she would rejoice to see him so happily matched. But after a fortnight of her cool detachment, I determined to spend as much time as possible away from the prickling discomfort of her disapproving stare, and it was this decision that led me to the unhappy resting place of the girl sprawled beneath a tree, her blood soaking the ground.</p><p>Bile burned my throat as I looked at her, my eyes drawn from her fingers to her face, framed by hair so similar in color and style to mine we might have been taken for twins. There was no question she was dead, no need to check for any sign of life. No one could have survived the brutal gashes on her throat. The bodice of her dress was black with blood and had been ripped at the abdomen, revealing what seemed to be an empty cavity.</p><p>I could look no further.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around my waist as my stomach clenched. I wasn&#x2019;t sick, but only because I was too horrified, too stunned even to breathe. Closing my eyes, I tried to focus, to move, to think, but was incapable of anything. I spun around at the sound of a sharp crack, like a branch breaking behind me, then turned back as my horse made a hideous shriek and reared. Realizing I&#x2019;d neglected to tie him to the tree, I started towards him, but was too late. He&#x2019;d already broken into a run.</p><p>Which left me six and a quarter miles from home, alone with the murdered girl.</p><p>Trees and grass and flowers spun around me as I tried to regain enough composure to take stock of the scene before me. I should have been better equipped to deal with this. In the past two years, I had become something of an investigator after solving the murder of my first husband, Philip, the Viscount Ashton, whom everyone had believed died of fever on a hunting trip in Africa. Since then, I&#x2019;d thrice more been asked to assist in murder cases, the last time while on my wedding trip in Constantinople. Colin, my second husband (and Philip&#x2019;s best friend), worked for the Crown, assisting in matters that required, as he liked to say, more than a modicum of discretion. Because no man could gain entrance to the sultan&#x2019;s harem, he had asked me to work with him in an official capacity when a concubine, who turned out to be the daughter of a British diplomat, was murdered at the Ottoman Palace.</p><p>Successful though I&#x2019;d been, none of my prior experience had prepared me for the sight before me now.</p><p>I squinted, blurring my vision so the field of poppies beyond the tree and the body melted into a wave of crimson buoyed by the wind. My boot slid on slick grass as I stepped forward and forced myself to look, memorizing every detail of the gruesome scene: the position of the girl&#x2019;s limbs, a description of her dress, the expression on her face. Simultaneously confident and sickened that I was capable of giving a thorough report of what I&#x2019;d seen, I turned and started the long walk back to the house, my stomach lurching, my heart leaping at every sound that came from the surrounding fields, my legs shaking.</p><p>For the briefest moment, I wanted to pretend that I&#x2019;d seen nothing, wanted to abandon myself to fear. Tears, ready to spill, flashed hot in my eyes, and I dug my fingernails into my palms. Which was when I heard a twig snap. I stopped long enough to see a rabbit scurrying across the path in front of me. And all at once, my fear turned to anger&#x2014;anger that I no longer felt safe in this place that was supposed to offer respite. Pulling myself up straight, I marched back to the house, ready to tell Colin we had work to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had taken me more than two hours to reach Mrs. Hargreaves&#x2019;s manor, nestled in a tree-filled grove deep in the Norman countryside northwest of Rouen, but as long rides had become my daily habit, I had not thought my absence would strike anyone as unusual. Hence my surprise when my husband rushed to greet me almost as soon as I&#x2019;d opened the door. Overcome with relief at the sight of him, I collapsed into his arms, hardly pausing to breathe as the story tumbled from my lips.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not hurt?&#x201d; he asked, patting my arms and taking a step back to inspect me.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. He looked me over again and then, seemingly satisfied, took me inside, sent the nearest servant to get the police post-haste, and sat me down on an overstuffed settee in the front sitting room. His mother, who had been reading, set aside her book and rose with a look of horror on her face.</p><p>&#x201c;What has happened?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Emily has found a body,&#x201d; Colin said, pacing the perimeter of the room. Mrs. Hargreaves remained perfectly still, her face serious, as he recounted for her all that had transpired.</p><p>&#x201c;The police?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Are already on their way,&#x201d; he said and directed his attention back to me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re quite certain of the location?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to show you. I don&#x2019;t know that I could explain how to get there,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t followed a specific route.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was frantic when your horse came into the garden without you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I wanted to look for you but had no idea what direction you&#x2019;d gone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine you frantic. You&#x2019;re beyond calm&#x2014;infuriatingly calm&#x2014;in the face of danger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not, my dear, when it comes to you. Not anymore.&#x201d; He sat next to me and took my hand, rubbing it with both of his.</p><p>&#x201c;I will not stand for you going all protective,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Next thing I know you&#x2019;ll be sending me to bed early and censoring the books I read.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know better than to try to influence your choice of reading material.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You do have excellent taste,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I might consider taking your advice.&#x201d;</p><p>His mother sighed loudly and all but rolled her eyes. &#x201c;I wish you would let me send for my physician to look her over, Colin,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Do you think, Lady Emily&#x201d;&#x2014;she insisted on addressing me formally, her voice full of sharp scorn, to remind me of her disapproval of the use of the courtesy title to which I, the daughter of an earl, was entitled&#x2014;&#x201c;that you&#x2019;ll be quite able to bear the sight of the body again? I can&#x2019;t help but worry about the constitution of such a delicate and sheltered girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be perfectly all right,&#x201d; I said, feeling my cheeks blush unpleasantly hot. &#x201c;Anyone would be upset by what I&#x2019;ve seen, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m incapable of doing the work necessary to ensure justice for the victim of this unspeakable crime.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And am I to believe you are better capable of achieving such a thing than the police?&#x201d; she asked. I had no time to reply as the butler announced Inspector Gaudet, a towering man, tall and broad, with a beard and handlebar mustache that made his face resemble George, newly created Duke of York, younger son of the Prince of Wales. His size, however, would have dwarfed the duke.</p><p>&#x201c;I assume,&#x201d; he said, crossing to me, &#x201c;that you are Madame Hargreaves, who found the body.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am Madame Hargreaves,&#x201d; Colin&#x2019;s mother said, stepping forward. &#x201c;I believe you want Lady Emily.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid my own lack of a title puts me beneath my wife in rank,&#x201d; Colin said, shaking the policeman&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Hence the confusion. But I must say, there&#x2019;s no other lady I&#x2019;d rather have precede me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, of course,&#x201d; Mrs. Hargreaves said. &#x201c;At any rate, Lady Emily is the one who found the murdered girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Investigation will determine the cause of death,&#x201d; Inspector Gaudet said.</p><p>&#x201c;There can&#x2019;t be much of a question,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;She was brutalized.&#x201d; Before I could stop them, tears sprang from my eyes. I pressed a handkerchief to my face and tried to compose myself.</p><p>&#x201c;I do not need you to describe for me what had been done to her. I&#x2019;ve already summoned a doctor to analyze the state of her body. He can&#x2019;t be more than ten minutes behind me. What I need is for you to show me the precise location of the scene. Do you feel able to do that? I understand how difficult all this is.&#x201d; His voice was full of sincere worry.</p><p>&#x201c;I appreciate your concern,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m prepared to do whatever is necessary.&#x201d;</p><p>Within a quarter of an hour the doctor and another policeman had arrived, and we were all mounted on horseback, Colin keeping close to my side. Mrs. Hargreaves had debated joining the party, but in the end was persuaded by her son to stay behind. We set off, and it quickly became apparent retracing my route was not quite so easy as I thought it would be. I had followed a path from the house beyond the road that led to the village, but then diverted through fields on whims in search of flowers, or to follow the sound of a particularly fetching birdsong, or hoping to find the peace that had eluded me since the day of my injuries in Constantinople.</p><p>&#x201c;I know it wasn&#x2019;t much farther,&#x201d; I said, frowning. I&#x2019;d made a habit of timing the length it took me to reach the beginning of the village road&#x2014;exactly half a mile from the house&#x2014;and I knew how long I&#x2019;d been riding at approximately the same speed. Six miles in any direction was not so easy to find, and I made enough missteps&#x2014;mistaking one field of poppies or flax or wheat for another&#x2014;that the others began to doubt I would be of any use to them. In the end, I managed to recognize from afar the twisted limbs of the tree that stood over the body.</p><p>My horse reared as we approached, sensing, I suppose, my own tension as much as it did the smell of blood that hung in the air. We all slowed, then stopped, no one moving for several minutes. I could not bring myself to look again at the hideous sight.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe it,&#x201d; Colin said, dismounting, his voice gruff. &#x201c;I never expected to see something like this again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Again?&#x201d; Inspector Gaudet stood next to him.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s as brutal as the murders in Whitechapel,&#x201d; he said. The collective terror that had descended on all of London when Jack the Ripper stalked women in the East End was something no English man or woman would soon forget. Chills crawled up my arms at the mere thought of his horrible handiwork. &#x201c;Emily, did you hear anything at all when you found her? Sounds that suggested someone was close by?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only the crack of a branch,&#x201d; I said, hesitating. &#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t say I was aware of much beyond her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She hasn&#x2019;t been dead long.&#x201d; The physician was kneeling beside her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky not to have arrived any earlier than you did, Lady Emily.&#x201d;</p><p>My eyes lost all focus. I came off the horse and tried to walk towards Colin, but my knees buckled. He stepped back and moved to catch me, but I pushed him away, knowing there was no stopping the inevitable. I ran as far as I could from the tree, then doubled over and was sick.</p><p>Gaudet turned to the other police officer. &#x201c;Organize a search. We must comb the entire countryside. Hargreaves, take your wife home and look after her. She&#x2019;s done all we need of her and ought not trouble herself with this matter any longer.&#x201d;</p><p>DANGEROUS TO KNOW Copyright � 2010 by Tasha Alexander</p></p><h2>The Cobra in the Barn: Great Stories of Automotive Archaeology</h2><p>It&#x2019;s the fantasy of every car enthusiast: Pull a tarp off a pile in a barn, or hear a farmer say ""there&#x2019;s an old car out back"" and discover a classic collectible such as a Hemi Cuda, a rare Porsche, or a Jaguar E-Type racer.

From their debut as the intermission band at London&#x2019;s Marquee Club in 1962 through their latest record&#x2014;setting <i>Bridges to Babylon</i> world tour, the Rolling Stones have defined a musical genre and experienced godlike adulation, quarrels, addiction, legal traumas, and descents into madness and death_while steadfastly refusing to fade away. Now Stephen Davis, the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Hammer of the Gods</i> and <i>Walk This Way</i>, who has followed the Stones for three decades, presents their whole story, replete with vivid details of the Stones&#x2019; musical successes_and personal excesses.<br><br>Born into the wartime England of air-raid sirens, bombing raids, and strict rationing, the Rolling Stones came of age in the 1950s, as American blues and pop arrived in Europe. Among London&#x2019;s most ardent blues fans in the early 1960s was a short blond teenage guitar player named Brian Jones, who hooked up with a lorry driver&#x2019;s only son, Charlie Watts, a jazz drummer. At the same time, popular and studious Michael Philip Jagger&#x2013;who, as a boy, bawled out a phonetic version of &#x201c;La Bamba&#x201d; with an eye-popping intensity that scared his parents&#x2013;began sharing blues records with a primary school classmate, Keith &#x201c;Ricky&#x201d; Richards, a shy underachiever, whose idol was Chuck Berry. In 1962 the four young men, joined by Bill Perks (later Wyman) on bass, formed a band rhythm and blues band, which Brian Jones named the &#x201c;the Rollin&#x2019; Stones&#x201d; in honor of the Muddy Waters blues classic. <br><br>Using the biography of the Rolling Stones as a narrative spine, <i>Old God Almost Dead</i> builds a new, multilayered version of the Stones&#x2019; story, locating the band beyond the musical world they dominated and showing how they influenced, and were influenced by, the other artistic movements of their era: the blues revival, Swinging London, the Beats, Bob Dylan&#x2019;s Stones-inspired shift from protest to pop, Pop Art and Andy Warhol&#x2019;s New York, the &#x201c;Underground&#x201d; politics of the 1960s, Moroccan energy and European orientalism, Jamaican reggae, the Glam and Punk subcultures, and the technologic advances of the video and digital revolution. At the same time, <i>Old Gods Almost Dead </i>documents the intense backstage lives of the Stones: the feuds, the drugs, the marriages, and the affairs that inspired and informed their songs; and the business of making records and putting on shows. <br><br>The first new biography of the Rolling Stones since the early 1980s, <i>Old Gods Almost Dead</i> is the most comprehensive book to date, and one of the few to cover all the band&#x2019;s members. Illustrated throughout with photos of pivotal moments, it is a celebration of the Rolling Stones as an often courageous, often foolish gang of artists who not only showed us new worlds, but new ways of living in them. It is a saga as raunchily, vibrantly entertaining as the Stones themselves.</p><p>"The most complete and informative biography of the Rolling Stones to date." <br>--<i>The Sacramento Bee</i><br><br>"A rip-roaring read...Davis's tour de force.

He lives and works in London.[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with BALTHAZAR, MOUNTOLIVE, and CLEA.]--The four linked novels that comprise English author Lawrence Durrell's masterpiece, THE ALEXANDRIA QUARTET, are set in Alexandria, Egypt, around the time of WWII. The four novels explore the city's polyglot society, full of intrigue, mystery, and sensuality, telling essentially the same story from different points of view. JUSTINE focuses on the beautiful Jewish wife of a wealthy Copt. Her story is told by Darley, her English lover. In BALTHAZAR, Darley reconsiders and retells the story he told in Justine, using information from a mysterious new character, Balthazar. In MOUNTOLIVE, as war begins to loom, British Ambassador David Mountolive enters the intrigues of the interwoven community of characters. In CLEA, Darley returns to a war-fevered Alexandria as the stories of the many characters move toward conclusion. Narrator Nigel Anthony provides a brilliant reading, keeping the variety of voices--English, French, Egyptian--distinct throughout. He offers a one-man play, conveying the passions, disappointments, and triumphs of the complex cast. The classical music interludes that delineate sections of this beautifully produced and packaged set help transport the listener to back- streets of Alexandria. R.E.K.

Patera Silk, a young cleric, attempts to ransom his parish buildings from creditors; in the process he uncovers a larger conspiracy involving the government of Viron and even the gods he worships. Emerging from the underground with his new knowledge, he finds himself chosen as leader ("Calde") of the masses and is simultaneously arrested. As a hero, Silk is good-natured but he lacks the energy and complexity required by his role. He often seems slighty lost, a lack of direction mirrored by the slowly developing narrative, which picks up only shortly before the finish. While the language is often inventive ("deadcoach" for horse-drawn hearse), it proves equally distracting; nor are the secondary characters distinctly depicted. Reference is made to the next volume of Wolfe's projected tetralogy, increasing the sense that this book is little more than a bridge between more important segments. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.The second volume in Wolfe's inspired new tetralogy, <i>The Book of the Long Sun</i>, continues looking like an sf masterwork in the making. Returning to the expansive, cityscaped interior of the Whorl, a massive space-faring vehicle whose origins are shrouded in legend, Wolfe resumes the story of Patera Silk, a cleric from a poor parish who turns thief to buy back his church from the wealthy crime lord, Blood. Silk plots to extort the required sum from Blood's hired physician, Dr. Crane, who, Silk discovers, is spying behind his employer's back. Following Crane's trail, Silk quickly finds himself entangled in the stratagems of operators shadier than himself and unwittingly stumbles on deeper secrets behind and below the Whorl. Wolfe excels at his own brand of richly textured mythmaking, embracing elements of magic without veering into fantasy. What emerges is a captivating narrative involving pious cyborgs, corrupt holy men, and mysterious high-altitude flyers, with subterranean tunnels, archaic technology, and televised messages from gods. Volumes three and four are avidly awaited. <i>Carl Hays</i></p><h2>Last Gunfighter: Killing Ground: The Killing Ground (The Last Gunfighter)</h2><p>Franks Morgan returns in William W.

After the bloody fall of Jerusalem, Sir Hugh establishes a new order of warrior monks as a cover for the excavation of the Temple Mount, and the race is on to find the hidden treasure, if it exists, before their activities are discovered.

Although Trungpa Rinpoche belonged to the tantra tradition, he acknowledged the strength and discipline gained from Zen influence. Through these talks you can see his respect for the Zen tradition and how it led to his using certain Zen forms for his public meditation hall rituals. He discusses the differences in style, feeling, and emphasis that distinguish the two paths and shows what each one might learn from the other. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Also included are Trungpa Rinpoche's commentary on the Ten Oxherding Pictures and an essay he composed in memory of Shunryu Suzuki Roshi, a close friend with whom he continually exchanged ideas for furthering buddhadharma in America.</p><p>CH�GYAM TRUNGPA (1940-1987)&#x2014;meditation master, teacher, and artist&#x2014;founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, the first Buddhist-inspired university in North America; the Shambhala Training program; and an international association of meditation centers known as Shambhala International. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>Shambhala: Sacred Path of the Warrior</i>, <i>Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism</i>, and <i>The Myth of Freedom</i>."This elucidating compilation is a unique milestone in the annals of philosophical and phenomenological thinking, as well as Buddhist practice. Scholarly and poetic, <i>The Teacup and the Skullcup </i>takes on the provocative nuances of Zen and tantra as 'consociational' allies in a new Western matrix. The compilation of discourse shows the inimitable brilliance of one of the twentieth century's greatest meditation teachers whose 'Socratic rap' and generosity to students is unsurpassed. East also meets East here, one could say, with wit, aesthetic grace, profound and subtle insight. I am so grateful."&#x2014;Anne Waldman<br><br>"For years Ch�gyam Trungpa dazzled us with his diamond wisdom at various venues from coast to coast. We delighted in his insights into the arts of Zen and its relationship to the tantric teachings. A whole generation of Buddhist was thus nourished. Now, <i>The Teacup and the Skullcup </i>skillfully makes available the heart of this extraordinary master to a new generation of practitioners. It should be on the bookshelf of every serious student of Buddhism."&#x2014;John Daido Loori<br><br>"Trungpa Rinpoche's astonishing take on Zen and tantra reads like a speech delivered from another planet. What we have in <i>The Teacup and the Skullcup</i> is less a work of explanation and exposition than a bravura performance&#x2014;a wild, weird demonstration of intellectual daring and outrageously dead-on spiritual vision."&#x2014;Norman Fischer<br><br>"<i>The Teacup and the Skullcup</i> is a jewel box of illumined insights, alert humor, and serious genius.

His central theme is the conflict between the ascriptive and consensual approaches to defining civic identities. The former reflects the predominance of political and economic pressures in legislative decision making and judicial interpretation at the expense of the latter, a more humanistic approach where the natural, organic rights of the individual determine the rights of citizenship. Smith concedes that the bifurcated nature of these forces is unavoidable in an inherently political society like ours, and yet he chastises politicians and jurists for their inability to repudiate half the formula, thus weakening his argument. Smith's book is an excellent chronology of the people, parties, movements, and developments in this often ignored area of American legal history, and its value in filling this gap outweighs the author's tendency for critical commentary out of historical context.

As the sun enters the astrological sign of Libra, the hours of dayand darkness are equal to one another, just like the balanced scales of Libra itself. From this point of the year, with each passing day, the daylight hours become noticeably shorter and the weather starts to cool. Autumn is a season of shadows and a time of wanlight, but it is also a season of abundance, thanksgiving, and harvest. <br> <br>Ancient people realized the importance of the sun to life on earth. In the time after the equinox, the sun appears to be growing weaker, losing its battle against the darkness. To help the sun regain its former strength, people held harvest festivals of light featuring torches and bonfires as an act of sympathetic magick to encourage the sun to return. <br>Autumn has always been our colorful season of reward. As the sun began to decline and its yearly job was finished, the people gratefully gathered in the field crops. The grains from the fields, the fruit from the orchards, and the vegetables from the garden were harto be safely stored away for winter. Everyone in the community was involved in the harvest, as folks needed to make sure they could gather in their crops before they spoiled or were ruined by inclement weather. <br> <br>At the end of the harvesting, the people were worn-out but happy and looked forward to a celebration. No matter where on earth the harvest is celebrated, from mid-August throughout the month of September, there is a basic and profound magick in the hearts of all people as they gather around with friends and family to feast and to celebrate the abundance of the earth. <br> <br>Autumn Equinox or Mabon? <br>A Harvest Festival No Matter How You Look At It <br> <br>The word equinox actually comes from the Latin word aequinoctium, which means "equal night." September, the seventh month of the Roman calendar, is taken from the Latin word "seven," septem. In Gaelic the month is identified as An Sultuine, the month of plenty. In Welsh it's called Medi, the month of reaping. The Anglo-Saxons called this month Gerst moanth, the barley month. Barley was thought to be the first grain grown in Britain. <br> <br>One of the modern names for this autumn sabbat was taken from the Welsh god Mabon. The story of Mabon and his mother, Modron, is as follows: Mabon was taken from his mother as she slept when he was only three nights old. Modron's cries of anguish were so great that a search or quest commenced to find the missing child. At this point the story ties into the Arthurian legends as some of King Arthur's knights, or the king himself, take up the quest to find Modron's son. They eventually rely on the wisdom of the five wisest animals to help them: the blackbird, the stag, the owl, the eagle, and the salmon. <br> <br>Eventually the child was discovered to be quite safe. He had been sleeping in his mother's womb or, depending on the version of the story, resting in the Underworld. In a plant analogy the child was resting just as a seed must rest beneath the earth before it can face the sunlight and brave the challenges of sprouting, growing, and flourishing. Now that Mabon's time had come, he was ready to face the world as God of Light and to be reborn as his mother's champion. <br> <br>This mythology eventually became wrapped up and associated with the celebration of the Autumn Equinox. For many Wiccans and Pagans this is a bit of a puzzle. How did this sabbat end up with this name, anyway? I never really did come to a conclusive answer. But it sure does make me wonder . . . maybe that's why there are so many different titles and names for this particular sabbat today. However, no matter what name you call this sabbat, the Autumn Equinox is a magickal time of balance and plenty. <br> <br>The majority of magickal traditions do celebrate this second harvest festival of the year as one of the fruits and the late grains. All around us signs are everywhere in nature, hintof the shortening days and cooler nights to come. The leaves are beginning to turn and the birds are beginning to migrate south. Apples and many varieties of squash are ripe and ready to be harvested, and the grapes that were harvested just a few weeks before, in late August-early September, begin to be processed into wine. <br> <br>In modern times, when few of us are so intimately linked to the land, the enchanting autumn festival of harvest can be a time to reap what good deeds you've sown. And, no matter where you live, you can still feel that connection to the seasons as they change. On this day of the autumnal equinox, the sun will rise at true east and then it will set straight at true west. So if you ever wondered where the cardinal points were exactly, here's your big chance. <br> <br>This is the perfect occasion to consider balance and harmony and how these forces are at work within your life. On this day, whether you call it the autumnal equinox or the sabbat of Mabon, this is your opportunity to celebrate the earth's bounty and gather in the fruits of your labors. This holiday is the Witch's Thanksgiving. So let's be thankful for all the blessings that we have. <br> <br>Here are a few of the many mythologies, harvest festivals, and harvest customs from around the world. Take a look at these and notice how the common theme of the great Earth Mother is tied throughout them all. <br> <br>Various Harvest Goddess Mythologies <br> <br>Throughout the world, in many mythologies, a goddess of the grain, the harvest, and the good earth was venerated at the Autumn Equinox. This is not surprising, as the Earth itself is seen as a fertile mother, or Gaia. From this matriarch all life was born. She is a great mother goddess who was known by many names throughout time and in numerous cultures. Some of these names include Astarte and Ishtar (to the Sumerians), Isis in Egypt, Demeter in Greece, and Ceres in Rome. To the indigenous people of the Americas she was known as Old Woman Who Never Dies and the Mother of Maize. <br>The harvest mother, Demeter, was a Greek goddess of grain and the fertile earth. Her characteristic of being the "spirit of the grain" is well-known in many cultures as Mother Earth's child. This child was represented by the seeds that fell from the mother plant, which would then be planted for the following year. Demeter would be visualized as the ripe crop of this year while her daughter, Persephone, would be the seed taken from it to be sown the following spring. <br> <br>The spirit of these future crops could be seen as a daughter, a maiden (such as Perseor as a divine child. In Russia the child was simply called the Corn Baby. In Egypt the spirit of the grain was the goddess's son, Horus. The Aztecs called the harvest goddess Chicomecoatl, while a goddess named Xilonen was Goddess of the New Corn. Her son was symbolized by the seeds and called the Spirit of the Corn. The Cherokees called the harvest child the Green Corn Girl. <br> <br>In other parts of the world such as southern India, there is a harvest festival called PonThis is a rice festival that lasts for three days. On the first day folks thank the gods for the rain that blessed the earth and that granted them a successful harvest. The second day is spent honoring the warmth and light of the sun that helped the plants grow tall. The third day of the festival honors the cattle who have helped to plow the fields and to bring in the harvest. It is traditional to decorate the horns of the cattle with paint, ribbons, fruit, and f lowers. The child who came from this harvest mother was called the Rice Baby. <br> <br>Harvest festivals are as plentiful as the crops produced in the counties in which they are grown. There are harvest festivals for corn, onions, pumpkins, apples, yams, grapes, hops, rice, barley, wheat, and sugar cane. In all parts of the world communities gather together to feast, to sing, and to dance as they celebrate the successful end of the growing season. <br> <br>Looking on the happy Autumn-fields, And thinking of the days that are no more. <br>alfred, lord tennyson <br> <br>Romancing the Harvest <br>Without a doubt the most frustrating aspect of researching this historical section was the general lack of information about Autumn Equinox customs. Some reference books claimed that in medieval Europe folks worshiped Demeter as a Corn Mother. Hold on a second . . . corn (or maize) is a native American plant, as in indigenous to the Americas. Did they even have corn in the Middle Ages in Europe? There was such a mishmash of information and customs tying into both the other harvest festivals of Lughnasadh (or Lammas) and Samhain that I began to wonder what in the world to do. I spent weeks trying to track down legitimate harvest custom information. <br> <br>Many of the folk customs that modern magickal people insist are from the "ancient" celebration of the autumnal equinox, or what modern Witches call Mabon, were actually tied into the first major grain harvest of the region. At my best estimate that would have probably occurred in the month of August. Bummer . . . I needed something for mid- to late September, around equinox time. <br> <br>Still, there was some information linking Autumn Equinox customs back to Harvest Home celebrations and, of course, to the Celtic festival of Samhain. There was a tempting thought-I could always take a look at the festivals when the first crops were brought in, at Lughnasadh, and the celebration of the third harvest, where everything was stored away in preparation for winter, at Samhain. <br> <br>But what about what we know today as the Wiccan holiday that falls on the Autumn Equinox? The title "Mabon" is, quite honestly, a fairly new name for this harvest festival. So I searched a little harder but kept coming up with more conflicting information. I could literally feel the gray hairs popping right out of my head. And just to keep me on my toes, the harvest festival dates would vary widely, depending on the region of the world these festivals were celebrated in. <br> <br>No wonder people think of this holiday as a forgotten sabbat! What about the grape or apple harvest, and what's up with all these references to Demeter as an ancient European corn goddess? There are even passages in the Golden Bough describing Demeter as holding "stalks of corn" and "ears of corn."Am I the only one who noticed that mistake? <br> <br>You Call It Corn, We Call It Maize . . . <br> <br>Demeter is safely known as a goddess of agriculture. But there are references to both Demeter and Ceres, her Roman counterpart, as corn mothers in the Greco-Roman period. Again, did the ancient Greeks and Romans grow corn as we know it today? Or was the whole thing a mistake caused by the Victorian time period, when folklore was considered fashionable and romantic? Or should I figure that it was a mistake caused by some well-meaning but overly idealistic writers from the 1970s, and that people kept running with the idea as holy writ? You know, the whole Oh, we've been celebrating this Pagan harvest festival of Mabon for hundreds of years type of thing. <br> <br>While that's a lovely thought, it really doesn't have any historical proof to back it up. Then, when I found references to Isis as a corn mother, I knew I was in big trouble. Okay, no way did the ancient Egyptians grow corn. I could maybe imagine how the maize plant, what modern Americans call corn, might have had seeds shipped over to Europe in the 1700s or 1800s-that's not too much of a stretch. But corn grown in ancient Egypt? That I just couldn't buy. I knew I was missing something-something important. I found a clue as I looked through a book on medieval gardens and what was commonly planted in them. There was a heading under "corn." When I looked it up, it said "see wheat." <br> <br>Excitedly, I f lipped back to the "W" section and looked at the entry for wheat. There I read that wheat was called "corn." Good grief. I slapped the book closed in frustration and tossed up my hands and . . . missed the forest for the trees. That afternoon, when my husband walked in the door, he made the huge mistake of asking how the research was coming. I gave him an earful. (No, that was not another corn reference, Goddess forbid.) <br> <br>He listened to me rant and then suggested looking at the agricultural history of Britain-maybe corn was being sowed in the late 1700s, he speculated. He ought to know, he comes from a long line of farmers. We could both visualize that seeds might have been exchanged. If there were crops of American corn, or maize, being grown in Europe during the 1800s, that would go along with my Victorian romance of the harvest theory. All those references to cornhusk dollies and corn mothers were really driving me up the wall. So I searched the Internet and hit pay dirt. <br> <br>The word corn once meant "a little particle of something such as a seed or a grain of wheat." Then I stumbled across the fact that in botany, the name corn is given to the leadcereal crop of any major region. In England, corn meant "wheat"; in Scotland and Ireland, corn was "oats." The grain called corn in the U.S. is properly or historically referred to as Indian corn, or maize. <br> <br>No wonder all those books kept referring to Demeter and Ceres as the goddess of corn, for she was. Demeter was the goddess of whatever the main crop of the region hapto be. That made Isis and Ishtar goddesses of corn, too. The word corn was being used as a term, not as the name of the plant. Eureka! <br> <br>Corn and grain, corn and grain, All that falls shall rise again . .. <br>wiccan harvest chant <br> <br>John Barleycorn and the Lord of the Harvest <br> <br>Now that I solved that problem, I figured I could take a fresh look at the harvest cusand the information that I could actually find. Since all of my information linked back into the two other harvest-theme sabbats, why not take another look at those? There are three harvest festivals in the Wiccan calendar and they are all connected. Well, we do love our trinities: three spring festivals, three harvest festivals, three faces of the goddess (Maiden, Mother, and Crone), and three aspects of the god (youth, a man in his prime, and the sage). <br> <br>The harvest celebrations all embrace the idea of sacrifice; however, it is a symbolic saconly. The sacrifice is the one made by the spirit of the grain, sometimes known as John Barleycorn. There is a very popular old ballad for John Barleycorn. It's been remixed into songs and you may find many versions of this poem all over the Internet. It is often listed as "author unknown." However, it was actually written by Robert Burns and pubin 1782. Now you'll notice some variation on the spelling; if the words throw you, just say the word out loud and you'll figure it out. <br> <br>It's sort of a gruesome ballad, but remember that what it is actually describing is the life span of the barley crops. We start with spring planting and then the summer growing season. Then it rolls into the hot days of late summer as the grain turns brown. Next comes the harvesting and then the process of threshing and grinding the grain. It does end with a twist, as the barley ends up becoming beer and the ballad has a toast to Scotall in one poem. <br> <br>John Barleycorn <br>There was three kings into the east, <br>Three kings both great and high, <br>And they hae sworn a solemn oath <br>John Barleycorn should die. <br> <br>They took a plough and plough'd him down, 9 <br>Put clods upon his head, <br>And they hae sworn a solemn oath <br>John Barleycorn was dead. <br> <br>But the cheerful Spring came kindly on, <br>And show'rs began to fall; <br>John Barleycorn got up again...</p><h2>A Daughter&#39;s Worth: A Bible Study for Teenaged Girls</h2><p>Ava H.

Many of the original Gor books have been out of print for years, but their popularity has endured. Each book of this release has been specially edited by the author and is a definitive text.</p><p><p>John Norman, born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1931, is the creator of the Gorean Saga, the longest-running series of adventure novels in science fiction history. Starting in December 1966 with "Tarnsman of Gor", the series was put on hold after its twenty-fifth installment, "Magicians of Gor", in 1988, when DAW refused to publish its successor, "Witness of Gor". After several unsuccessful attempts to find a trade publishing outlet, the series was brought back into print in 2001. Norman has also produced a separate, three-installment science fiction series, the Telnarian Histories, plus two other fiction works ("Ghost Dance" and "Time Slave"), a nonfiction paperback ("Imaginative Sex"), and a collection of thirty short stories, entitled "Norman Invasions". "The Totems of Abydos" was published in spring 2012. All of Norman's work is available both in print and as ebooks. The Internet has proven to be a fertile ground for the imagination of Norman's ever-growing fan base, and at Gor Chronicles (www.gorchronicles.com), a website specially created for his tremendous fan following, one may read everything there is to know about this unique fictional culture. Norman is married and has three children.</p></p><h2>Christmas Stories from Grandmas Attic</h2><p>Grandma Mabel relates the events of many past Christmases.</p><p></p><h2>Guardians of the Galaxy &amp; X-Men: The Black Vortex</h2><p>The Black Vortex, an ancient artifact imbued with immeasurable power, is now in the hands of Mr. Knife!

She enjoys reading, walking the Moors, playing tennis, and dreaming of winning Wimbledon.Grade 3-6?First impressions can be somewhat deceiving. This handsomely designed title features an inviting layout: boxed captions; crisp, full-color photographs; and compressed information presented in double-page spreads. Varying type sizes lead the eye from headings to descriptions. Frequent diagrams illustrate where each group of instruments is seated in the orchestra, and fascinating trivia bites will intrigue browsers without overwhelming them. Organization of information could not have been better orchestrated. The accompanying compact disc, Benjamin Britten's classic The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, sonorously narrated by Ben Kingsley, paired with The Sorcerer's Apprentice, makes this package almost irresistible. Unfortunately, the scope of the presentation is just too vast. While the author glances at instruments and music of the world and peeks at learning about running an orchestra, she doesn't give a complete enough picture of the generic orchestra. There are only two very small color photos of orchestras, and the gorgeous, large, detailed illustrations of the seven highlighted instruments lack labels. The inadequate glossary does not define the cor anglais, which is mentioned, but not pictured. Neil Ardley's Music (Knopf, 1989) has pictures and diagrams of more instruments and covers the world of music, including rock, but has no information about composers or the orchestra. Betty Lou English's You Can't Be Timid with a Trumpet (Lothrop, 1980; o.p.) provides a grand, personalized tour of instruments and musicians.?Marilyn Payne Phillips, University City Public Library, MO<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Christianity: Essence, History, Future</h2><p>"A big book on a big subject by the biggest name in contemporary theology ...

His skin is yellowish, almost translucent now; his head hangs limply over the edge of the table. The glow from the oil lamp on the wall reveals the tracks of tears down his filthy cheeks and a thread of blood drips from his nose. The man whipping him stands in silence for a moment, uncertain, one hand gripping the pizzle, the other mopping from his brow the sweat that also soaks his shirt. Then he turns to a third man leaning against the door in the shadows behind him. The face of the man with the whip bears the hangdog look of a hound cowering before its master. A brutish, lumbering mastiff.<br><br>In the silence comes the sound of the Atlantic pounding against the shore beyond the shuttered window. No one has said a word since the screaming stopped. Twice, the dark face of the man in the doorway is illuminated by the glowing ember of a cigar.<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t him,&#x201d; he says finally.<br><br>Every man has a breaking point, he thinks, though he does not say as much aloud. Not before his dull-�witted companion. Every man will break at a precise point if only he can be brought to it. It is simply a matter of delicacy, of finesse. Of knowing when and how to stop. One more gram on the scales and everything goes to hell. Comes to nothing. Becomes, in short, a fruitless waste of energy. Of time and effort. Blows struck blindly while the true target is making good his escape. Useless sweat, like that of the torturer now mopping his brow, bullwhip in hand, waiting for the order to continue.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing more to be done here.&#x201d;<br><br>The other man looks at him, slow, uncomprehending. His name is Cadalso&#x2014;�the word means a gibbet&#x2014;�an apt name given his office. Cigar clenched between his teeth, the man in the doorway moves to the table and, stooping slightly, peers at the unconscious body: unshaven, dirt crusted on his neck, on his hands and between the violet weals crisscrossing his torso. Three more lashes, he calculates; perhaps four. By the twelfth blow, he knew all he needed to know, but it was important to be sure. Besides, in this case no one will ask awkward questions. This man was a vagrant wandering the docks. One of the countless human wrecks washed up in C�diz by the war and the French siege, just as the sea washes flotsam onto its shores.<br><br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d;<br><br>The man with the bullwhip blinks, struggling to take in this news. It is almost possible to see the information trickling through the narrow winding pathways of his brain.<br><br>&#x201c;If you let me, I can&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a fool. I&#x2019;m telling you it wasn&#x2019;t him.&#x201d;<br><br>He continues to study the unconscious man closely. The eyes are half-�open, fixed and glassy, though the man is not dead. In his professional career Rogelio Tiz�n has seen enough corpses to recognize the symptoms. The beggar is breathing shallowly and a vein, bloated by the awkward position of his neck, is pulsing weakly. Leaning down, the comisario becomes aware of the acrid stench of damp, dirty skin, of urine spilled on the ground under the force of the lash. The sweat caused by fear&#x2014;�colder now as the unconscious man grows pale&#x2014;�is very different from the other sweat, the animal reek of the man standing nearby holding the whip. With a rictus of disgust, Tiz�n takes a deep pull on his cigar, exhales a long plume of smoke that fills his nostrils, obliterating the stench. Then, he stands up and walks back to the door.<br><br>&#x201c;When he comes round, give him a couple of coins and warn him that if he breathes a word of complaint hereabouts, we will skin him alive. Like a rabbit.&#x201d;<br><br>He drops his cigar stub, crushes it with the toe of his boot then takes his broad-�brimmed hat, his cane and his gray redingote from the chair, opens the door and steps out into the blinding sunlight; in the distance, beyond the Puerta de Tierra, the city of C�diz unfurls, white as the sails of a ship perched upon stone walls that seem to rise from the sea.<br><br>Flies buzz. They have come early this year, in search of carrion. The body of the girl still lies on the Atlantic shore of the reef, at the foot of a sand dune whipped by the east wind. Kneeling next to the body, the woman Tiz�n has had brought from the city works busily between the girl&#x2019;s thighs. The woman is a respected midwife and one of Tiz�n&#x2019;s regular informants. They call her T�a Perejil. She once worked as a whore around La Merced. Tiz�n trusts her instincts&#x2014;�and his own&#x2014;�more than he trusts the doctor the police habitually call on, a drunken, mercenary butcher. This is why he calls on this woman for his cases. Twice now in the space of three months. Or four times, if he includes the alewife stabbed by her husband and the innkeeper murdered by a student in a fit of jealous rage. But those were very different cases: it was clear from the outset that they were crimes of passion. Routine. The two murdered girls are a different matter, a strange and much more sinister affair.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; says T�a Perejil as Tiz�n&#x2019;s shadow alerts her to his presence. &#x201c;Her maidenhood is intact, she&#x2019;s as pure as she was when her mother brought her into this world.&#x201d;<br><br>The comisario looks down at the gagged face of the dead girl, her tangle of hair fouled with sand. Fourteen, fifteen perhaps; a scrawny little thing, hardly more than a child. Her skin has been blackened, her features bloated by the heat of the morning sun, but this is nothing compared to the horror of her back, which has been whipped and flayed down to the stark white bones that contrast with the mutilated flesh and congealed blood.<br><br>&#x201c;Just like the other one,&#x201d; adds the midwife.<br><br>She rearranges the girl&#x2019;s dress to cover her legs, then stands up, brushing sand from her clothes. She picks up the shawl that is lying nearby and uses it to cover the dead girl&#x2019;s back, swatting the swarm of flies away from the wounds. The shawl is made of thick brown flannel, as plain as the rest of her clothes. The victim has been identified as a maid who worked at a cheap lodging house outside the city, midway between the Puerta de Tierra and the fortifications at La Cortadura. She had set off on foot to visit her frail mother yesterday afternoon while it was still light.<br><br>&#x201c;So what about the beggar, Se�or Comisario?&#x201d;<br><br>Tiz�n shrugs as T�a Perejil looks at him inquisitively. She is a tall, stout woman, sapped by life rather than age. She is almost toothless and gray roots are visible beneath the dye that tints her greasy mane of hair, which is tied up with a kerchief. Around her throat she wears a necklet of holy medals and devotional scapulars, a rosary hangs from a cord at her waist.<br><br>&#x201c;So it wasn&#x2019;t him, then? . . . From the way he screamed, it sounded like he was guilty.&#x201d;<br><br>The comisario glares at the midwife until she looks away.<br><br>&#x201c;Hold your tongue, or you&#x2019;ll find yourself screaming too.&#x201d;<br><br>T�a Perejil is an inveterate scandalmonger but she has known Tiz�n for a long time, long enough to know when he is not in the mood for confidences. And today is such a day.<br><br>&#x201c;Forgive me, Don Rogelio, I spoke in jest.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Save your jests for your sow of a mother should you meet her in hell.&#x201d; Tiz�n slips two fingers into his jacket pocket, extracts a silver duro and tosses it to her. &#x201c;Now get out of here.&#x201d;<br><br>As the woman walks away, the comisario surveys the scene again, as he has a dozen times already. The east wind has long since erased any footprints from the previous night. Besides, ever since the body was discovered by a muleteer who went to a neighboring inn to give the alarm, the countless comings and goings have obliterated any clues there might have been. Tiz�n stands motionless for a moment, alert to anything that might have escaped his notice, then gives up, disheartened. One long track catches his eyes, a broad groove in the side of the dune, and he crouches down to inspect it. As he squats there, he has the fleeting impression that this has happened before, that he has seen himself crouching, studying traces in the sand. But his mind cannot bring the memory into focus. Perhaps it is nothing more than one of those strange dreams that later seem so real, or perhaps that brief, inexplicable feeling that what is happening has happened before. The comisario gets to his feet having reached no conclusions: the furrow could have been caused by an animal, by a body being dragged, by the wind.<br><br>As he passes the corpse he notices that the wind has lifted the girl&#x2019;s skirt, baring her leg to the knee. Tiz�n is not a tender-�hearted man. His profession is brutal and certain rough edges particular to his character have long since led him to think of a corpse&#x2014;�whether in sun or shade&#x2014;�as simply a piece of rotting flesh. As a chore that will entail complications, formalities, investigation, reports to his superiors. Nothing that is likely to trouble the sleep of Rogelio Tiz�n Pe�asco, Commissioner for Districts, Vagrants and Transients, who has spent thirty-�two of his fifty-�three years working as a policeman, making him a wily old dog. But on this occasion even the hard-�nosed comisario cannot help but feel vaguely uncomfortable. And so, with the tip of his cane, he moves the skirt back into place and piles a little heap of sand on it so it will not fly up again. As he does so, he spots a half-�buried shard of metal, twisted like a corkscrew. He bends down and picks it up, weighing it in his hand. He immediately recognizes it as a piece of shrapnel created when the French shells explode. There are shards of metal like this all over C�diz. This one probably came from the yard outside Lame Paco&#x2019;s Tavern where a bomb recently exploded.<br><br>He drops the piece of metal and walks back towards the white-�washed wall of the tavern where a group of onlookers is being kept at bay by two soldiers and a corporal sent by the duty officer at San Jos� at the request of Tiz�n, who felt confident that a few uniforms would command some respect. The crowd is made up of menials, serving wenches from neighboring taverns, muleteers, local mothers and their tykes. Standing at the front, by virtue of his status both as the innkeeper and the person who informed the authorities when the body was discovered, is Lame Paco.<br><br>&#x201c;They say it wasn&#x2019;t the beggar what done it,&#x201d; Paco says as Tiz�n draws level with him.<br><br>&#x201c;They speak the truth.&#x201d;<br><br>The beggar had been skulking around for several days and the local innkeepers were quick to point the finger when the murdered girl was discovered. In fact it was Paco who had arrested the beggar, kept a hunting rifle trained on him until the police arrived and made sure he wasn&#x2019;t roughed up too badly: just a few kicks and punches. The disappointment is visible on the faces of the crowd&#x2014;�especially the boys, who now will have no one at whom they can hurl the stones they&#x2019;ve stuffed in their pockets.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sure, Se�or Comisario?&#x201d;<br><br>Tiz�n does not trouble himself to answer. He looks thoughtfully at the section of wall destroyed by the French shell.<br><br>&#x201c;When did the bomb fall, my friend?&#x201d;<br><br>Thumbs hooked into his belt, Lame Paco comes and stands next to Tiz�n, respectful and a little cautious. He knows the comisario of old and knows that &#x201c;friend&#x201d; is simply a turn of phrase and one that, coming from Tiz�n, could just as easily be a threat. Because Lame Paco is not lame, he has never had a limp, but his grandfather did and in C�diz nicknames are inherited more surely than money. As are professions. Lame Paco has a face framed by gray whiskers and it is common knowledge that he was a sailor and a smuggler in the past, not to mention the present. Tiz�n knows that Paco&#x2019;s cellars are full of merchandise from Gibraltar, he knows that on nights when the sea is calm and the wind temperate, the beach is alive with the dark shapes of boats and shadowy figures hauling contraband. Sometimes they even smuggle cattle. But for as long as Lame Paco continues to bribe Customs officers, soldiers and policemen&#x2014;�including Tiz�n&#x2014;�to look the other way, no one is going to ask questions about whatever is hauled up on this beach. It would be a very different matter if the innkeeper were to become greedy and attempt to shirk his obligations, or if&#x2014;�as some in the city and elsewhere have done&#x2014;�he were to traffic with the enemy. But of that there is no evidence. In the end the people of C�diz, from the Castillo de San Sebasti�n to Zuazo Bridge, know each other of old and in spite of the war and the siege, they are content to live and let live. This includes the French, who have not launched a serious attack on the city for some time, shelling it from a distance as though simply observing the formalities.<br><br>&#x201c;The bomb fell yesterday morning, just after eight,&#x201d; the innkeeper explains, gesturing to the east of the bay. &#x201c;It came from over there, from La Cabezuela. The wife was hanging out the washing and saw the flash. Then boom, it exploded over there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Any damage?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not much&#x2014;�that bit of wall, the pigeon loft, a few dead chickens . . . The shock was the worst of it. The wife nearly passed out. Thirty paces closer and it would have been a different story.&#x201d;<br><br>Tiz�n digs a fingernail between his teeth&#x2014;�he has a gold canine on the left&#x2014;�as he gazes across the mile-�wide inlet of sea that separates the reef&#x2014;�C�diz is on a peninsula, on one side are the shores of the Atlantic, on the other the bay, the harbor, the salt marshes and the Isla de L�on&#x2014;�from the mainland occupied by the French. The east wind has swept away the clouds so it is possible to see the French fortifications at the Trocadero: to the right the Fort San Louis, to the left the half-�ruined walls of the Matagorda and slightly farther away the fortified cannonry of the Cabezuela.<br><br>&#x201c;Have any other shells fallen around here?&#x201d;<br><br>Lame Paco shakes his head, then gestures toward the Reef on either side of his tavern.<br><br>&#x201c;They get a few up near Aguada, and down near Puntales they rain down all day&#x2014;�the people round there have to live like moles . . . This is the first time one has fallen here.&#x201d;<br><br>Tiz�n nods distractedly, still looking toward the French lines, blinking against the dazzling sunlight reflected off the whitewashed wall, the water and the dunes. He is calculating a trajectory, comparing it to others. Something has just occurred to him. It is a hunch, a vague feeling. A nagging sense of foreboding coupled with the conviction that he has somehow experienced this before. Like a line of attack on a chessboard&#x2014;�in this case, the city&#x2014;�made before Tiz�n could notice it. Two pawns, including the one today. Two pieces captured; two girls.<br><br>There might be some connection, he thinks. He has witnessed more complex chess strategies while sitting outside the Caf� del Correo. Has played them himself, devised them, or used them to counter an adversary&#x2019;s attack. Like a lightning flash, he has an unexpected vision: chess pieces laid out, an unremarkable game, and suddenly, an ambush from behind the knight, a bishop or a pawn, the Attack&#x2014;�and its Capture; a corpse lying at the foot of the dune, dusted with sand carried by the wind. And hovering over all this like a dark shadow, the inkling of something he has experienced before, something he has seen, kneeling as he was then before the traces in the sand and thinking. If only he could remember, everything would be fine. Suddenly, he feels an urgent need to retreat behind the safety of the city walls and begin the necessary investigations. The need to castle, while he considers his strategy. But before he does so, he walks back to the body and, without a word, fumbles in the sand for the twisted hunk of metal and slips it into his pocket.<br><br>Meanwhile, three-�quarters of a league east of Lame Paco&#x2019;s Tavern, unsh...</p><h2>Heart of a Lion</h2><p>In his newest series, much-loved master storyteller Gilbert Morris turns his imagination to the Jewish ancestry of Jesus of Nazareth. Combining extensive research with skillful plotting, Morris creates believable scenarios and great stories. The result is an exciting series with riveting, action-packed adventures that will entertain, enlighten, and challenge readers as never before. In the series debut, Heart of a Lion, Noah struggles to resist the siren call of the world&#39;s pleasures, while straining to hear the still, small voice of his father&#39;s God. The reader is in for a roller-coaster ride of surprises as humanity&#39;s common ancestor fights the spiritual battle of the ages.</p><p><p>Gilbert Morris spent ten years as a pastor before becoming Professor of English at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkansas and earning a Ph.D. at the University of Arkansas. During the summers of 1984 and 1985, he did postgraduate work at the University of London. A prolific writer, he has had over 25 scholarly articles and 200 poems published in various periodicals, and over the past years has had more than 180 novels published, including THE HOUSE OF WINLSOW series, LIONS OF JUDAH series and CHENEY DUVALL, M.D. His family includes three grown children, and he and his wife live in Alabama.</p>*Starred Review* The indefatigable Morris, who has tackled everything from westerns to science fiction, tries his hand at biblical fiction in the first installment of Lions of Judah, a series featuring the lineage of Christ. <i>Heart of a Lion </i>begins with a lively account of Noah's boyhood, when he struggled with his feelings for a young woman who worships Baal. Eventually, after conquering a number of demons, Noah settles upon a monastic carpenter's life while he awaits directions from the Ancient One. The gathering of animals and the Great Flood could hardly fail to be entertaining, and they are, though it's hard not to recall John Huston's rather more earthy rendition of Noah in <i>The Bible. <i>John Mort</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His obscure and hard to find stories are finally collected here.</strong></p> Welcome to the bizarre world of Fletcher Hanks, Super Wizard of the Inkwell. Fletcher Hanks worked for only a few years in the earliest days of the comic book industry (1939-1941). Because he worked in a gutter medium for second-rate publishers on third-rate characters, his work has been largely forgotten. But among aficionados he is legendary. At the time, comic books were in their infancy. The rules governing their form and content had not been established. In this <em>Anything Goes</em> era, Hanks' work stands out for its thrilling experimentation. At once both crude and visionary, cold and hot as hell, Hanks' work is hard to pigeon hole. One thing is for certain: the stuff is bent. Hanks drew in a variety of genres depicting science-fiction saviors, white women of the jungle, and he-man loggers. Whether he signed these various stories "Henry Fletcher" or "Hank Christy" or "Barclay Flagg" there is no mistaking the unique outsider style of Fletcher Hanks.<br><br> Cartoonist Paul Karasik (co-adapter of Paul Auster's <em>City of Glass</em>, and co-author of <em>The Ride Together: A Memoir of Autism in the Family</em>) has spent years tracking down these obscure and hard to find stories buried in the back of long-forgotten comic book titles. Karasik has also uncovered a dark secret: why Hanks disappeared from the comics scene. This book collects 15 of his best stories in one volume followed by an afterword which solves the mystery of "Whatever Happened to Fletcher Hanks," the mysterious cartoonist who created a hailstorm of tales of brutal retribution...and then mysteriously vanished.<br><br><strong>2008 Eisner Award WINNER: Best Archival Collection/Project &#x2015; Comic Books<br> 2008 Eisner Award Nominee: Best Short Story, "Whatever Happened to Fletcher Hanks?" by Paul Karasik</strong> Full-color comics throughout</p><p>Paul Karasik is the co-author (along with David Mazzucchelli) of the perennial graphic novel classic City of Glass, adapted from Paul Auster&#x2019;s novel.

Few in suburban Surrey mourn the violent passing of Division Commander Alastair Gilbert, whose arrogance and cruelty were legendary in his village and in wider police circles -- which only makes the job of Scotland Yard investigators Superintendent Duncan Kincaid and Sergeant Gemma James more difficult. And as every discovery reveals another instance of misplaced trust, festering secrets, and murderous rage, they must put aside their own personal feelings for the victim -- and for each other -- in the name of justice and the law.</p></p><p>The three things that make Deborah Crombie's books about a pair of Scotland Yard detectives so fascinating are (a) the way the relationship between Superintendent Duncan Kinkaid and Sgt. Gemma James is constantly--and believably--changing; (b) the meticulously researched and impeccably presented details of British police procedure; and (c) the fact that the superb chronicler behind these multi-layered tales of British society is a native Texan and current resident of a small town near Dallas. This fourth entry in Crombie's excellent series sends the gently raised, intellectual Kinkaid and the tougher, more abrasive James out after the killer of a much-unloved senior policeman in suburban Surrey. Other books in the series also available in paperback are <i>All Shall Be Well</i>, <i>Leave the Grave Green</i>, and <i>A Share in Death</i>.When a high-ranking police officer is brutally murdered, Scotland Yard Superintendent Duncan Kincaid and Sergeant Gemma James are drawn into a case that not only challenges their investigative skills but forces them to examine their ethics and their relationship with each other. On an evening in mid-November, Alastair Gilbert, a Commander in the London Metropolitan Police, is found dead in the kitchen of his suburban Surrey home by his wife, Claire, and seventeen-year-old stepdaughter, Lucy. Gilbert was bludgeoned to death, and there was no sign of forced entry. Someone must have taken Gilbert by surprise - or the killer was someone he trusted. Kincaid was once Gilbert&#39;s student at the police academy, and he fears his personal antipathy toward the dead man may lessen his objectivity in the case. Even more distracting is the state of his relationship with Gemma - strained and tense ever since their intimate encounter a few days earlier. Both Duncan and Gemma must try to put their feelings for each other and their memories of Alastair Gilbert aside as they discover that Gilbert did not always play by the rules that he publicly espoused, particularly when the rules might have hindered his rise to power.</p><h2>The Word for Today Bible: New King James Version</h2><p><p>For over 30 years, Pastor Chuck Smith, founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, has been bringing Biblical truth alive in the hearts of believers.&nbsp; The <em>Word for Today Bible</em> focuses on a selection of his most powerful teachings and is packed with commentary, illustrations, and insights that guide readers to a deeper understanding of scripture.&nbsp; Through key features like introductions to each book of the Bible, articles connected to ideas found in the scriptures, and sidebars that illuminate key passages, you'll benefit from Smith's simple, yet profound teaching and experience a Spirit-filled life.</p></p><p></p><h2>The pushcart war</h2><p>The outbreak of a war between truck drivers and pushcart peddlers brings the mounting problems of traffic to the attention of both the city of New York and the world.</p><p>The pushcarts have declared war!

Even with our wetsuits.&#x201d; Sami Dawson, her best friend and roommate, was right behind her, laughing at the insanity of their decision.<br> <br>&#x201c;Only for a few minutes.&#x201d; Mary Catherine&#x2019;s long golden red hair was caught up in a ponytail and it flew behind her as she ran. She was laughing, too, but more because she loved starting her Saturday like this. &#x201c;Once we&#x2019;re in we won&#x2019;t feel a thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>They carried their boogie boards as they ran through the shallow surf and then jumped over the frigid foamy breakers. In no time they were in up to their shoulders, past the foam and ready to ride the next set of waves.<br> <br>Mary Catherine shook the water from her hair, breathless. &#x201c;See? It isn&#x2019;t terrible!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; Sami shivered. She nodded to the wave headed their way. &#x201c;Come on. Keep moving.&#x201d;<br> <br>They caught the first one and rode it all the way to shore. The spray of cool seawater in their faces, the rush of the powerful ocean beneath them. Mary Catherine loved everything about this. She felt alive and whole and connected to God.

But for now she would enjoy this moment. And she would remember what her mother told her years ago. Life could never be measured in the number of days a person lived, but only by the beautiful, brilliant life that had colored those days.<br> <br>Mary Catherine paddled back out alongside Sami. Her friend&#x2019;s eyes were wide. &#x201c;I think I saw a dolphin.&#x201d; She pointed behind the waves. &#x201c;Like fifteen feet that way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mary Catherine scanned the distant water. &#x201c;I hope it wasn&#x2019;t a shark.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Sami let out a quiet scream. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say that!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m kidding.&#x201d; Mary Catherine laughed again. &#x201c;I saw it, too. A few of them. Definitely dolphins.&#x201d;<br> <br>Another swell came and again they caught the ride all the way in. They took their boards and sat on the wet sand, trying to catch their breath. Sami shook her shoulder-length dark hair. &#x201c;Thank you for making me do this. I&#x2019;m not cold.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect out here.&#x201d; Mary Catherine headed back out. &#x201c;Come on. A few more.&#x201d;<br> <br>They pushed through the white surf to the smooth area and waited. Sami wiped the water from her face. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait for tonight. I really think Marcus is onto something with this youth center.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me, too. I&#x2019;m glad we&#x2019;re going early.&#x201d; Mary Catherine felt it, the way she always did at the mention of Marcus&#x2019;s name. A feeling that started in her heart and made its way down her arms and up the back of her neck. She hated the reaction. The last thing she needed was a crush on Marcus Dillinger. &#x201c;Is he still dating his coach&#x2019;s niece?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He is. We&#x2019;re double-dating with them next week.&#x201d; Sami wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re a good match.&#x201d; She shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Between her heart condition and half a dozen charities she was involved with, Mary Catherine certainly had no time to worry about a professional baseball player. The guy could never be her type.<br> <br>They rode a few more waves and then Mary Catherine nodded to the shore. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s dry off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good idea. I still have to do laundry before we meet up with the guys.&#x201d;<br> <br>Their towels were ten yards up the beach, and after a few minutes they pulled on sweats and sat on the sand facing the water. Mary Catherine turned her face to the winter sun and savored the way it melted through her. How could anything be wrong with her heart? She felt too good to be sick.<br> <br>The quiet suited them. Since rooming together a few years ago they&#x2019;d had the sort of friendship that could erupt into laughter or feel comfortable in complete silence. They were very different, she and Sami. Mary Catherine broke the silence. &#x201c;Did you and Tyler have fun last night?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We did.&#x201d; Sami&#x2019;s smile lit up her face more than the morning sun ever could. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe how good things are. I think he&#x2019;s going to ask me to be his girlfriend. Officially.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mary Catherine jumped to her feet. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; She danced around in a circle. &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; She raised both fists in the air. &#x201c;Yes, yes, yes!&#x201d; Then just as quickly she dropped back to the beach. &#x201c;What in the world is taking so long?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well . . .&#x201d; Sami shrugged, sheepish. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s more me. Like I told you.&#x201d; This time her laugh sounded more nervous. &#x201c;I needed time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on.&#x201d; Mary Catherine leaned back on her hands and grinned at her friend. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been in love with him since you were in high school.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I was practically engaged to Arnie.&#x201d; Sami&#x2019;s tone held a mock protest, nothing serious. After a few seconds she burst into the sort of laughter she and Mary Catherine shared so often. &#x201c;Okay, okay! You&#x2019;re right. I don&#x2019;t need much more time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on.&#x201d; Mary Catherine leaned forward and crossed her legs. &#x201c;How long before he&#x2019;ll ask you to marry him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d; Sami looked shocked. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not rush things!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be long.&#x201d; Mary Catherine raised her eyebrows. &#x201c;You heard it from me first.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re crazy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But in this case, also right.&#x201d; Mary Catherine let her silliness fade, let the breeze off the ocean frame the moment, the significance of it. &#x201c;Was it beautiful? Your date?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was. We were at Disneyland, as you know.&#x201d; She looked so much happier than before, back when she was dating Arnie. &#x201c;When it was dark he took me to the bridge in front of Sleeping Beauty&#x2019;s castle.&#x201d; Sami was sitting cross-legged now, facing Mary Catherine. &#x201c;He told me he never stopped adoring me, never stopped thinking about me. Even with every bad decision he made back then.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s sweet.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sami&#x2019;s smile held a contentment that hadn&#x2019;t been there in the beginning, back when Tyler first returned to Los Angeles. &#x201c;He says he has just one regret now. One that still haunts him.&#x201d; She paused and lifted her face toward the sun for a few seconds before looking back at Mary Catherine. &#x201c;That he ever left me at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>The story touched Mary Catherine. She couldn&#x2019;t be happier for her friend, for the love she&#x2019;d found. &#x201c;I want to be maid of honor.&#x201d; She held up both hands in a teasing surrender. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;m saying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Seriously, though . . . you could be right.&#x201d; Again Sami&#x2019;s joy was tangible. &#x201c;I love him so much. This new Tyler, the one with lessons learned and a faith that gets stronger every day . . . I just never dreamed we would have a second chance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did.&#x201d; Mary Catherine gave Sami a knowing look. &#x201c;Remember?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;True.&#x201d; Sami&#x2019;s laugh mixed with the disbelief she still clearly felt. &#x201c;You told me I couldn&#x2019;t leave Florida on that business trip, unless I spent a few hours with him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just say I&#x2019;m a very good friend.&#x201d; Mary Catherine grinned.<br> <br>&#x201c;Definitely maid of honor status.&#x201d;<br> <br>The sun was higher in the sky, temperatures heating up. Mary Catherine allowed the silence again. She needed some kind of buffer before she could tell Sami the truth about her health. The one thing they&#x2019;d never talked about. She checked her phone. Nearly eleven o&#x2019;clock. They needed to be at the newly renovated youth center by three that afternoon to help with last-minute details for the grand opening.<br> <br>Finally Mary Catherine shifted on her towel so she was facing Sami. &#x201c;You ever wonder why I changed my eating habits lately? No more frozen pizza?&#x201d;<br> <br>Sami&#x2019;s smile came easily. &#x201c;The whole no sugar, no gluten, no grain thing?&#x201d; She uttered a quick laugh. &#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re amazing and you like feeling good enough to climb walls and jump out of planes?&#x201d; She laughed again. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I always figured. I sure couldn&#x2019;t eat that clean.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mary Catherine hated what was coming. She wanted everyone in her world to go on thinking she had switched up her eating because of her zest for life. Nothing more. She hesitated.<br> <br>Finally Sami&#x2019;s laughter faded. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Mary Catherine&#x2019;s smile remained, but she could feel a sadness filling her eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m diabetic. Type two.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Sami put her elbows on her knees and leaned closer. &#x201c;Since when? How come you never told me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I only found out last month, and my eating keeps it under control.&#x201d; She angled her head, willing her friend to understand. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like thinking about it. Obviously. And, well, the way I eat I don&#x2019;t need pills or shots. I check my blood sugar every morning. So far, it&#x2019;s controlled.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sami hesitated. &#x201c;Okay, good. You scared me for a minute.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s more. Diabetes runs in our family.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Just like congenital heart defects. My uncle died because of his heart disease when he was in his late twenties. My mom never had any problem, but the gene passed on to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Again Sami looked beyond confused. She stared at Mary Catherine. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying . . . there&#x2019;s something wrong with your heart?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mary Catherine took a slow breath. &#x201c;I was born with a coarctation of the aorta, and a bicuspid aortic valve. I had emergency surgery when I was a few weeks old and since then I get checkups every year.&#x201d; She forced her smile. &#x201c;No big deal.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You should&#x2019;ve said that first.&#x201d; Sami looked like she wasn&#x2019;t sure whether to relax or expect more news. &#x201c;So . . . you&#x2019;re okay? Like long-term?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really.&#x201d; She hadn&#x2019;t talked about this with anyone. Not even her parents. &#x201c;I had a checkup last week. My heart&#x2019;s enlarged&#x2014;which isn&#x2019;t good. And my valves are deteriorating. I&#x2019;ll need a transplant sometime in the next year.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sami pulled her knees up to her chest and hung her head for several seconds. When she looked up, there was no mistaking the fear in her eyes. &#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The valve transplant isn&#x2019;t the worst thing. People survive those&#x2014;though mine will be trickier for a lot of reasons.&#x201d; Mary Catherine looked to the sky; the California sun filled the morning. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my enlarged heart that&#x2019;s the real problem. Even with a transplant I may not have more than ten years. Maybe less.&#x201d;<br> <br>The color left Sami&#x2019;s face and she simply stared, like she couldn&#x2019;t begin to believe the news. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s . . . awful.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only one who knows.&#x201d; She reached out and gave Sami&#x2019;s hand a brief squeeze. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my best friend, Sami. I&#x2019;ve been looking for a way to tell you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sami hung her head for a long moment again. When she turned to Mary Catherine, there were tears in her eyes. &#x201c;There must be something they can do. Your parents know the best doctors, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They do. But this . . . well, you can&#x2019;t fix an enlarged heart like mine. There are drugs that can slow the process. But that&#x2019;s about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe this.&#x201d; Sami stared at the sky. A minute passed before she lowered her arms and faced Mary Catherine again. Tears fell down her cheeks. &#x201c;We have to find another opinion.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done that.&#x201d; She looked straight into Sami&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;Look, the reason I&#x2019;m telling you is so you&#x2019;ll pray. God can do anything&#x2014;even with this.&#x201d; Again, she worked to keep discouragement from her voice. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I care so much about living. Why I&#x2019;m always talking about only living once. Because I don&#x2019;t have as long as most people.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sami wiped her tears with her fingertips. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fair.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is.&#x201d; Mary Catherine sat up straighter. &#x201c;God&#x2019;s given me all these years of life and probably many more. I still have lots to do&#x2014;like get that youth center up and running tonight. And maybe move to Africa for a year and work with orphans.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You always say that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it one of these days.&#x201d; Mary Catherine found her smile again. &#x201c;Of course, I&#x2019;ll probably skydive another dozen times at least, and look.&#x201d; She turned her face toward the ocean again. &#x201c;I have mornings like this, with you.&#x201d; She felt a familiar peace fill her soul. &#x201c;God has been far more than fair with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you in pain? I mean . . . like, does it make your chest hurt?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; She raised her hands and dropped them again. &#x201c;I feel perfect.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Sami looked off, her expression marked with sorrow. &#x201c;What about love?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about it?&#x201d; Mary Catherine felt her heart sink.<br> <br>Sami stared at her. &#x201c;You deserve love.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She shook her head. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t have time.&#x201d; Mary Catherine felt tears sting her own eyes. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m okay with that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sami looked into her eyes again. &#x201c;You were going to find someone real, remember? Someone like you, with faith like you and a love for life like you.&#x201d; Sami shook her head. &#x201c;That was supposed to be the miracle of your life.&#x201d; She exhaled hard. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sami . . . it&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d; Mary Catherine put her hand on her friend&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;God&#x2019;s going to give me a different kind of miracle.&#x201d; She stood and reached out her hand. &#x201c;Come on. Let&#x2019;s go find those dolphins.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sami waited several seconds before she took Mary Catherine&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; She shaded her eyes so she could see better. &#x201c;Can you do this? Swimming in the ocean? Is that good for you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all good.&#x201d; She slipped back into her wetsuit and ran a few steps ahead. &#x201c;The more life in my days, the better. Then it doesn&#x2019;t matter how many days I have. Just that I really lived them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hate this.&#x201d; Sami climbed into her wetsuit and caught up to her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re probably supposed to be home resting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Never.&#x201d; Mary Catherine grabbed her boogie board and ran through the surf. Her laughter mixed with the sound of the waves. &#x201c;God wants me out here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sami paddled alongside her. The moment they reached the calm area before the swells, they spotted the dolphins. Three of them, playing in the water a few yards away.<br> <br>&#x201c;See!&#x201d; Mary Catherine&#x2019;s joy was as genuine as the sun on the water. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to miss this.&#x201d;<br> <br>For the first time in many minutes, Sami smiled again. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anyone like you, MC.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take that as a compliment.&#x201d; Mary Catherine looked over her shoulder as the perfect wave came straight for them. &#x201c;Here we go!&#x201d;<br> <br>And with that they both caught the wave and started to ride it in. The moment they did, Mary Catherine spotted two of the dolphins riding alongside them. &#x201c;Look!&#x201d; she shouted.<br> <br>Sami turned her head and saw what was happening just before the dolphins kicked out of the wave and headed back out to sea. &#x201c;Wow!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That never happens!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So beautiful.&#x201d; Sami was laughing now, too.<br> <br>Mary Catherine turned her attention to the shore as the ride continued. Tears filled her eyes and mixed with salt water and a happiness that knew no limits. The heaviness from earlier was gone. No matter how many years she had or where God would lead her from here, one thing would always be true.<br> <br>As long as she drew breath, she would spend her days living.</p><h2>Jim Tolpin's Woodworking Wit &amp; Wisdom (Popular Woodworking)</h2><p><p><b>Did you know?</b></p><ul><li>The three most fundamental and essential tools can't be bought.</li><li>Sanding is the slowest, most tedious, and most counterproductive way to prepare a surface for the clearest, richest finish.</li><li>The absolute strongest bends are made without bending the wood.</li><li>A scrap of tarpaper and a chunk of scrap wood comprise one of the most precise layout tools available to a woodworker.</li><li>There is no such thing as a mistake in woodworking.</li></ul><p>Well, neither did I when I started working wood more than 30 years ago.

He was, Rooney allows, not prime military material. He had a knack for enraging the drill instructors with his wisecracks, and for pulling harsh assignments as a result, and his shenanigans got him disqualified from officer candidacy. Still, Rooney survived boot camp and served for a time as an artilleryman until being reassigned to the daily newspaper <i>Stars and Stripes</i>. Lucky for him, too: in 1942 his old outfit ran into trouble in North Africa, fighting against Erwin Rommel, and although few of them were killed, Rooney writes, "there's a good possibility I would have spent all of 1943, 1944, and six months of 1945 in a German prison camp."<p> In <i>My War</i>, a fine and wholeheartedly irreverent memoir, Rooney--later to gain fame as a <i>60 Minutes</i> commentator--recounts what happened instead. As a correspondent, he saw combat up-close while honing his craft alongside such fellow chroniclers as Ernie Pyle and Bill Mauldin. What he witnessed will perhaps not please some survivors and students of the war, especially those who revere Gen. George S. Patton--whom Rooney charges with having committed improprieties, injustices, and even war crimes in the quest to secure personal fame.</p><p> Though the book is a personal memoir, Rooney has taken pains to square his anecdotes with the historical record. However, he writes, "It is distressing for me to note how infrequently the facts concur with my memory of what happened." (In such cases, he adds, he assumes that the facts are wrong.) Affecting, occasionally disturbing, and thoroughly well-written, Rooney's memoir is a welcome addition to the literature of "the good war." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>ca&#39;s favorite commentators writes a moving, funny, and highly evocative account of his life as an Army private and Stars and Stripes reporter during World War II.

So when she discovered that schools today forego handwriting drills in favor of teaching something called <em>keyboarding</em>, it gave her pause: &#x201c;There is a widespread belief that, in a digital world, forming letters on paper with a pen is pointless and obsolete,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;and anyone who thinks otherwise is right up there with folks who still have fallout shelters in their backyards.&#x201d;</p><p>Florey tackles the importance of writing by hand and its place in our increasingly electronic society in this fascinating exploration of the history of handwriting. Weaving together the evolution of writing implements and scripts, pen collecting societies, the golden age of American penmanship, the growth in popularity of handwriting analysis, and the pockets of aficionados who still prefer scribbling on paper to tapping on keys, she poses the question: Is writing by hand really no longer necessary in today&#x2019;s busy world?</p><p><strong>Kitty Burns Florey</strong> is the author of <em>Sister Bernadette&#x2019;s Barking Dog: The Quirky History and Lost Art of Diagramming Sentences</em>.

With her husband, Ron Savage, she divides her time between central Connecticut and upstate New York.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Michael Dirda Like many people over the age of 40, I still have a callused knobby excrescence on the third finger of my right hand, the place where pencils and ballpoints and fountain pens have been resting ever since I first began to learn the Palmer method of cursive handwriting. Kids no longer have this "writer's bump," since cursive isn't seriously taught any more. For the most part, young people born into the computer age can, by focusing hard, just about sign their names in longhand, but otherwise they rely almost entirely on printing or, more and more often, keyboarding. Today Truman Capote would have to quip: "That's not writing, that's word processing." Sad to say, I just typed the above paragraph on a laptop. No handwriting implements were involved in the production of those sentences. I do feel mildly guilty about this: In four broken coffee cups scattered artfully around my desk are a half-dozen fountain pens -- among them an old Esterbrook (a gift from the writer Glenway Wescott), a Pelikan with an italic nib, a handsome Namiki retractable -- and scores of Bics, rollerballs, felt tips and gel markers, as well as innumerable pencils, most of them with the names of museums, universities or other cultural sites etched on their sides. As it happens, I do use most of these hand tools of the writer's trade, usually the pencils, when scribbling notes in the margins of books I'm reviewing. Nonetheless, so poor is my script that these notes often turn indecipherable even to me after just a few hours. It's seriously frustrating to read: "The really important point is amxiwyby sowkymx, rather than roeqcz or kfghi." As Kitty Burns Florey points out in her highly enjoyable Script and Scribble, clear and readable handwriting does matter: "The TV drama ER often tackles the issue: in one 2007 episode, Dr. Izzie Stevens tells the interns she's supervising, 'Penmanship saves lives! Is that a 7, or is that a 9? If I have to ask myself that in the middle of an emergency, your patient is dead. You killed him. With your handwriting. Think about that!' " In contrast to medical cacography, which can kill us, calligraphy -- that is, "beautiful writing" -- simply takes our breath away. The novelist John Crowley, for instance, is almost as well known for the elegance of his handwriting as for the elegance of his prose -- which is why a special edition of Little, Big sold out so quickly: Subscribers could choose a favorite passage, and Crowley would personally copy it out for them. Once, following a lecture by the professional scribe Sheila Waters, I managed to snag the big pieces of paper upon which she casually drew her magnificent O's, A's and M's. Even these throwaways were so striking that I had them framed and hung on a wall of my apartment. Script and Scribble actually mentions Waters, as well as one of her most famous commissions: a handwritten and illuminated copy of Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood. But a mention is almost all we get, and before long Florey is on to some other aspect of handwriting practice and history. Because she's witty and often endearingly autobiographical (she includes illustrations from her third-grade writing workbook), the reader is happy to follow her into any byway of penmanship. Still, this account of "the rise and fall of handwriting" never aims to be more than a breezily enjoyable introduction. Those seriously intrigued by the subject will want to go on to the books that Florey mentions, in particular Edward Johnston's classic Writing &amp; Illuminating &amp; Lettering and Wilfred Blunt's Sweet Roman Hand: Five Hundred Years of Italic Cursive Script. That said, Script and Scribble really is charming and does offer chapters on such matters as the origin of letter forms, the development of the pen and pencil, and the evolution of various schools of handwriting practice in America. In our history the great names are Platt Rogers Spencer, whose much admired script will be familiar from the distinctive Coca-Cola logo, and A.N. Palmer, whose methods for teaching cursive dominated the lives of elementary school students for most of the last century. Palmer himself learned from a writing master named George Gaskell, author of several practical works, among them Gaskell's Compendium of Forms, Educational, Social, Legal and Commercial. That desirable volume includes sample letters such as this delightful one from a concerned mother to her daughter away at school: "I have been somewhat alarmed because your last two letters do not run in that strain of unaffected piety as formerly. What, my dear, is the reason? Does virtue appear unpleasant to you? Are you resolved to embark in the fashionable follies of a gay, unthinking world?" Am I alone in regretting the disappearance of such elegantly corseted prose? Probably. One chapter of Script &amp; Scribble may seem slightly out of place: A longish account of graphology, the interpretation of character through the study of how one shapes letters and words. Florey seems to half believe in this pseudo-science, even as she recognizes how authorities pooh-pooh its supposed findings and predictions: She notes, for instance, that "the British Psychological Society ranks graphology alongside astrology: both possess 'zero validity' in determining personality." My favorite chapter, that on "Writing By Hand in a Digital Age," opens with several pages about contemporary novelists who still use pens for at least their initial drafts: Mary Gordon, Paul Auster, J.K. Rowling, Toni Morrison ("pencil and yellow pad"), Joyce Carol Oates, John Irving, Patrick Leigh Fermor, William Boyd, Jim Harrison and Wendell Berry, among others. Even the prolific Stephen King likes to write in longhand: "He was forced to do so when sitting at the computer became painful after he was struck by a car in 1999, and continues to prefer it." In this chapter, Florey also discusses the value of manuscripts and rough drafts in deepening our understanding of the published poem or novel. Today, though, she concludes that the only place where extended writing by hand commonly continues is in the keeping of diaries. While Florey clearly (and rightly) admires Portland, Ore., where the schools teach italic handwriting, she ends by advocating a stripped-down blend of italic and printing as a possible ideal for classrooms. I wish. Alas, as she herself writes, "In the world of incessant testing and 'No Child Left Behind,' there's scant time for handwriting instruction. For the most part, beautiful penmanship now lives on the planet where people gather around the piano and sing, watch Gunsmoke on TV, and go to major-league baseball games in the afternoon: it's the planet of nostalgia." Who would disagree? But some of us happen to love that old planet. After reading Script and Scribble, I feel like digging out my beat-up calligraphy manuals by Tom Gourdie, Marie Angel and Lloyd J. Reynolds. Of course, I also need to clean out the dried ink from my italic pen. But before you know it, even Ludovico Arrighi -- the great Renaissance master of italic -- will be envying my p's and q's. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

We need the term <i>unbornness,</i> as well as the term <i>immortality,</i> to encompass the whole human being.&#x201d; (Rudolf Steiner)<br><br>As anyone who has had a child knows, newborns enter the earthly world as beings different from their parents. They arrive with their own individuality, being, and history. From the beginning, they manifest an essential dignity and a unique &#x201c;I,&#x201d; which they clearly brought with them from the spiritual world. <br><br>This unborn life of a person&#x2019;s higher individuality guides the whole process of incarnation. It frames our lives, but we fail to recognize this because of a single-minded focus on immortality, or life-after-death, which makes us forget the reality of our &#x201c;unbornness.&#x201d; This unbornness extends not only from conception to birth, but also includes the whole existence and history of one&#x2019;s &#x201c;I&#x201d; in its long journey from the spiritual world to Earth. Unbornness&#x2015;the other side of eternity&#x2015;allows us to experience the fact that birth is just as great a mystery as is death. In a new and striking way, unbornness poses the mystery of our human task on Earth. <br><br>It was one of Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s great gifts that he returned the concept of unbornness to human consciousness and language. In this brief, stunning, and moving, almost poetic work, Peter Selg gathers the key elements and images needed to begin an understanding of&#x2015;and wonder at&#x2015;the vast scope of our unbornness. Drawing on and expanding on Steiner&#x2019;s work, as well as Raphael&#x2019;s <i>Sistine Madonna</i> and the poems of Nelly Sachs and Rainer Maria Rilke, Selg unveils this deepest mystery of human existence. After reading it, one will never look at a child or another human being in the same way again. <br><br><p>Life after death <br> life before birth; <br> only by knowing both<br> do we know eternity. <br> (Rudolf Steiner)</p> <br><i>Unbornness</i> is a translation of <i>Ungeborenheit: Die Pr�existenz des Menschen und der Weg zur Geburt</i> (Verlag Ita Wegman Institut, 2009).</p><p><b>Peter Selg</b>&nbsp;was born in 1963 in Stuttgart and studied medicine in Witten-Herdecke, Zurich, and Berlin.

Have diets you&#39;ve tried in the past failed or even been counter-productive? Are you sure your diet is right for your blood type? This breakthrough programme is the only one to reveal the hidden key to successful dieting. Your blood type reflects your internal chemistry and actually determines the way you absorb nutrients. What foods you absorb well and how your body handles stress differ with each blood type and plays a key part in losing weight, avoiding disease and promoting fitness and longevity. Based on that knowledge, Eat Right 4 Your Type provides a set of blood type-specific diets to help you learn how to combine the foods that are right for you.</p><p>This abridged audiobook introduces Dr. Peter J. D'Adamo's revolutionary approach to dieting based on the connection between blood type and health. Read by audio pro Polly Adams, D'Adamo's bestseller details how different foods affect specific blood types both positively and negatively. We learn that "pastas made from buckwheat are better tolerated for Type Os," and that type As should eliminate all meat from their diet to reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer. Adams blends an efficient, no-nonsense delivery and warm tones that may remind some of a favorite talk-radio personality. And considering the important subject matter, listeners will appreciate all of these qualities. While some dieters may find the suggestions too progressive--it's recommended that women with a history of breast cancer in their family introduce snails into their diet--this is a beneficial three-hour investment for dieters seeking alternative nutritional plans. (Running time: three hours, two cassettes) <i>--Cate Bick</i>Dr. D&#39;Adamo has spent the past fifteen years researching the connections among blood type, food, and disease, and his research is built on thirty years of work done by his father. Now Dr. D&#39;Adamo offers a total resource for health, an individualized plan that&#39;s right for your blood type. In Eat Right 4 Your Type he shows which foods, spices, teas, and condiments help someone of your blood type maintain optimal health and ideal weight; which vitamins and supplements to emphasize or avoid; which medications function best in your system; whether your stress goes to your muscles or your nervous system; whether your stress is relieved better through aerobics or meditation; whether you should walk, swim or play tennis or golf as your mode of exercise; how knowing your blood type can help you avoid many common viruses and infections; how knowing your blood type can help you fight back against life-threatening diseases; and how to slow down the aging process by avoiding factors specific to your blood type that cause rapid cell deterioration.</p><h2>DOCTOR STRANGE: DAMNATION (IRON FIST)</h2><p>The city of sin gets its biggest sinner yet.

By the author of Secret Affairs. 50,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p><b>Irwin F. Gellman</b> is Trustees' Professor of Modern American History at Chapman University in Orange, California, and lives in nearby Corona Del Mar. He has published three books on Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his administration.A meticulously researched revisionist account (the first volume of a projected three) of Richard Nixon's public career, from a Putitzer-winning author (Secret Affairs, not reviewed). After Nixons resignation from the presidency in 1974, it was popular to argue that the character flaws that emerged in the Watergate crisis were evident in his first political campaigns and his tenure as a congressman and senator. Not so, contends Gellman (Modern American History/Chapman Coll.). Basing his conclusions on Nixon's recently declassified personal papers, Gellman concludes that the popular image of Nixon as a ruthless liar and conniver who rose to national prominence through irresponsible Red-baiting is actually a myth. Instead, Gellman argues, Nixon was ``a success story in a troubled era, one who steered a sensible anticommunist course against the excess of McCarthy and other extreme right-wingers.'' Charges, still widely believed, that Nixon smeared Jerry Voorhis in his 1946 congressional campaign and Helen Gahagan Douglas in his 1950 Senate campaign are false, Gellman asserts, born of partisanship and unfairness. Instead, both campaigns were divisive but ``hard-fought and deeply emotional'' on both sides. Gellman traces Nixon's involvement in the Hiss-Chambers case, which first brought him national prominence, his rapid rise in the national GOP organization as a senator who focused on the issues of communism and the Korean War, and the 1952 nominating convention in which he suddenly emerged as a dark horse vice-presidential candidate. Arguing that Nixon's nomination was the culmination of several political forces, including the high profile Nixon earned in the Hiss case, Gellman counters the widespread notion that Nixon manipulated his way to the 1952 nomination. Nixon had no managers, he points out, and Dwight Eisenhower had expressed interest in capturing the vote of young people with a youthful running mate. The 39-year-old Nixon seemed to fit the billhe was ``young, patriotic, articulate, and dependable,'' and in Ike's view became the logical choice for the ticket. A substantial contribution to Nixon scholarship. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

His first short story collection, The Watch, set in Texas, won the PEN/Nelson Algren Award, and his 2002 collection, The Hermit&#39;s Story, was a Los Angeles Times Best Book of the Year. The Lives of Rocks was a finalist for the Story Prize and was chosen as a Best Book of the Year by the Rocky Mountain News. Bass&#39;s stories have also been awarded the Pushcart Prize and the O. Henry Award and have been collected in The Best American Short Stories.In this journal of a back-country winter, Bass is working in the tradition of Walden. Wishing to confront the essentials of nature and self, he heads for the most remote place he can find--the Yaak valley of Montana, with its 30 inhabitants and lack of electricity. The journal focuses on his adaptation to the harsh climate, stressing his growing knowledge of backwoods skills and lore. Unfortunately, Bass rarely goes beyond recording daily tasks and encounters. He conveys little insight into the spiritual changes he is undergoing and has surprisingly little to say about the relation of man and nature. His writing has been compared to that of Annie Dillard and Peter Matthiessen, but these flat, sketchy accounts belie such comparisons. In the end, "notes" is an all-too-appropriate subtitle for this disappointing volume, which often seems like the skeleton of a more substantial work.<br><i>-Lawrence Rungren, Bedford Free P.L., Mass.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Saturday: A novel</h2><p>From the pen of a master &#x2014; the #1 bestselling, Booker Prize&#x2013;winning author of <b>Atonement</b> &#x2014; comes an astonishing novel that captures the fine balance of happiness and the unforeseen threats that can destroy it.

It&#x2019;s not clear to him when exactly he became conscious, nor does it seem relevant. He&#x2019;s never done such a thing before, but he isn&#x2019;t alarmed or even faintly surprised, for the movement is easy, and pleasurable in his limbs, and his back and legs feel unusually strong. He stands there, naked by the bed &#x2013; he always sleeps naked &#x2013; feeling his full height, aware of his wife&#x2019;s patient breathing and of the wintry bedroom air on his skin. That too is a pleasurable sensation. His bedside clock shows three forty. He has no idea what he&#x2019;s doing out of bed: he has no need to relieve himself, nor is he disturbed by a dream or some element of the day before, or even by the state of the world. It&#x2019;s as if, standing there in the darkness, he&#x2019;s materialised out of nothing, fully formed, unencumbered. He doesn&#x2019;t feel tired, despite the hour or his recent labours, nor is his conscience troubled by any recent case. In fact, he&#x2019;s alert and empty-headed and inexplicably elated. With no decision made, no motivation at all, he begins to move towards the nearest of the three bedroom windows and experiences such ease and lightness in his tread that he suspects at once he&#x2019;s dreaming or sleepwalking. If it is the case, he&#x2019;ll be disappointed. Dreams don&#x2019;t interest him; that this should be real is a richer possibility. And he&#x2019;s entirely himself, he is certain of it, and he knows that sleep is behind him: to know the difference between it and waking, to know the boundaries, is the essence of sanity.<br><br>The bedroom is large and uncluttered. As he glides across it with almost comic facility, the prospect of the experience ending saddens him briefly, then the thought is gone. He is by the centre window, pulling back the tall folding wooden shutters with care so as not to wake Rosalind. In this he&#x2019;s selfish as well as solicitous. He doesn&#x2019;t wish to be asked what he&#x2019;s about &#x2013; what answer could he give, and why relinquish this moment in the attempt? He opens the second shutter, letting it concertina into the casement, and quietly raises the sash window. It is many feet taller than him, but it slides easily upwards, hoisted by its concealed lead counterweight. His skin tightens as the February air pours in around him, but he isn&#x2019;t troubled by the cold. From the second floor he faces the night, the city in its icy white light, the skeletal trees in the square, and thirty feet below, the black arrowhead railings like a row of spears. There&#x2019;s a degree or two of frost and the air is clear. The streetlamp glare hasn&#x2019;t quite obliterated all the stars; above the Regency fa�ade on the other side of the square hang remnants of constellations in the southern sky. That particular fa�ade is a reconstruction, a pastiche &#x2013; wartime Fitzrovia took some hits from the Luftwaffe &#x2013; and right behind is the Post Office Tower, municipal and seedy by day, but at night, half-concealed and decently illuminated, a valiant memorial to more optimistic days.<br><br>And now, what days are these? Baffled and fearful, he mostly thinks when he takes time from his weekly round to consider. But he doesn&#x2019;t feel that now. He leans forwards, pressing his weight onto his palms against the sill, exulting in the emptiness and clarity of the scene. His vision &#x2013; always good &#x2013; seems to have sharpened. He sees the paving stone mica glistening in the pedestrianised square, pigeon excrement hardened by distance and cold into something almost beautiful, like a scattering of snow. He likes the symmetry of black cast-iron posts and their even darker shadows, and the lattice of cobbled gutters. The overfull litter baskets suggest abundance rather than squalor; the vacant benches set around the circular gardens look benignly expectant of their daily traffic &#x2013; cheerful lunchtime office crowds, the solemn, studious boys from the Indian hostel, lovers in quiet raptures or crisis, the crepuscular drug dealers, the ruined old lady with her wild, haunting calls. Go away! she&#x2019;ll shout for hours at a time, and squawk harshly, sounding like some marsh bird or zoo creature.<br><br>Standing here, as immune to the cold as a marble statue, gazing towards Charlotte Street, towards a foreshortened jumble of fa�ades, scaffolding and pitched roofs, Henry thinks the city is a success, a brilliant invention, a biological masterpiece &#x2013; millions teeming around the accumulated and layered achievements of the centuries, as though around a coral reef, sleeping, working, entertaining themselves, harmonious for the most part, nearly everyone wanting it to work. And the Perownes&#x2019; own corner, a triumph of congruent proportion; the perfect square laid out by Robert Adam enclosing a perfect circle of garden &#x2013; an eighteenth-century dream bathed and embraced by modernity, by street light from above, and from below by fibre-optic cables, and cool fresh water coursing down pipes, and sewage borne away in an instant of forgetting.<br><br>An habitual observer of his own moods, he wonders about this sustained, distorting euphoria. Perhaps down at the molecular level there&#x2019;s been a chemical accident while he slept &#x2013; something like a spilled tray of drinks, prompting dopamine-like receptors to initiate a kindly cascade of intracellular events; or it&#x2019;s the prospect of a Saturday, or the paradoxical consequence of extreme tiredness. It&#x2019;s true, he finished the week in a state of unusual depletion. He came home to an empty house, and lay in the bath with a book, content to be talking to no one. It was his literate, too literate daughter Daisy who sent the biography of Darwin which in turn has something to do with a Conrad novel she wants him to read and which he has yet to start &#x2013; seafaring, however morally fraught, doesn&#x2019;t much interest him. For some years now she&#x2019;s been addressing what she believes is his astounding ignorance, guiding his literary education, scolding him for poor taste and insensitivity. She has a point &#x2013; straight from school to medical school to the slavish hours of a junior doctor, then the total absorption of neurosurgery training spliced with committed fatherhood &#x2013; for fifteen years he barely touched a non-medical book at all. On the other hand, he thinks he&#x2019;s seen enough death, fear, courage and suffering to supply half a dozen literatures. Still, he submits to her reading lists &#x2013; they&#x2019;re his means of remaining in touch as she grows away from her family into unknowable womanhood in a suburb of Paris; tonight she&#x2019;ll be home for the first time in six months &#x2013; another cause for euphoria.</p><h2>The Essential Steiner: Basic Writings of Rudolf Steiner: Knowledge, Nature, and Spirit; Spiritual Anthropology; Historical Vision; Esoteric Christianity; Society and Education</h2><p>Essays by the distinguished Austrian social philosopher include discussions of the theory of human nature, the mystical teachings of Christianity, and the roots of education</p><p><b>Robert McDermott</b>, Ph.D., is president emeritus and chair of the Philosophy, Cosmology, and Consciousness Program at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS).

When the film of &#34;Othello&#34; was planned by Welles, the author was hired as Iago. This book is an account of the travails attendant on the production, which constantly ran out of money, and is also an acerbic and witty assessment of Welles himself.</p><p></p><h2>The English Teacher</h2><p>The author of The Pleasing Hour offers a moving novel of a single mother who has sheltered her son for many years at the private school where she works as an English teacher but who is beginning to unravel as secrets from her past catch up with her.</p><p>For a former English teacher, picking up a novel called The English Teacher required a leap of faith. There's the risk of running into that egomaniac so widely adored in stories about English teachers, a subgenre that reached its low point with Robin Williams's mawkish performance in "Dead Poets Society." Michelle Pfeiffer was hotter in "Dangerous Minds," but she followed essentially the same lesson plan, with the same test results: one student dead and a nation inspired.<p>For the millions of responsible teachers more interested in explaining literature than saving souls, such portrayals are an embarrassment to the class. And so it was a relief to find that the heroine in Lily King's new novel makes a fascinating counterpoint to these celebrated emotional leeches. Vida Avery is the best teacher at Fayer Academy, a wealthy prep school on an island off the coast of New England. During her 15-year career, Vida has been offered every honor and position such a school can bestow on its finest, but she's resisted these allurements. She remains cloistered in an old attic classroom, a position that simultaneously emphasizes her modesty and her specialness.</p><p>Vida's legendary classes on English and American literature lead students through discussions of themes, characters, settings and styles. She tolerates no distractions, tangents or sloppy expressions in speech or prose. When her sophomores try to draw her off track with personal questions, she immediately brings them back to a novel by Thomas Hardy: "Let's talk about Tess. She's far more interesting." Rather than coyly encouraging their intimacies, she feels "impatient with them for stepping behind the curtain of her private life." She doesn't want them to love her; she wants them to love literature.</p><p>But we quickly learn that Vida's pedagogical discipline stems from her unhealthy avoidance of real life. "She wasn't interested in the present," King writes. "Moments in novels were unforgettable, while in real life the details slipped quickly away." Something has happened, we're led to believe -- something ghastly and unthinkable that caused Vida to abandon her past and remake herself 15 years ago when she appeared on the steps of Fayer Academy with a baby. Since then, she's lived on the island campus, raised her son with hawk-like attention, gained a reputation for being a strict but brilliant teacher and avoided all emotional entanglements. </p><p>Which makes her sudden marriage to a recent widower, Tom Belou, a complete shock to everyone -- including herself. "What had she done?" she keeps asking herself. "She wished she'd never said she loved him. She was just being polite, returning the compliment late one evening." But now here she is, shattering the safe little life she's managed to construct for herself and her son and throwing them both into a new house, with new children (Tom's three) still grieving for their dead mother. From the wedding night on, Vida is a mess: frigid in the bedroom, nervous in the kitchen, shrill at the table. She has no idea what to do with these new stepchildren, how Tom can love her, or why she married him.</p><p>And neither do we. As in her debut novel, The Pleasing Hour, King has taken the old vaudeville advice to heart: "Leave 'em wanting more." She may, in fact, be too devoted to that maxim. The English Teacher suffers from a kind of literary anorexia; there's not enough meat on these characters or enough connective tissue on the bones of this plot. Though we eventually learn what trauma forced Vida to reinvent herself all those years ago (not too hard to guess), we never get answers to the more important questions raised by these characters' relationships in the present. (Why does she get married? Why does he stay with her?) </p><p>The wedding takes place in 1979, on the same day the U.S. embassy staff is taken hostage in Iran, which serves as a provocative but ultimately irrelevant metaphor for Vida's sense of entrapment. More promising are the frequent references to Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which Vida begins teaching the Monday after her wedding. But here, too, the allusions are more illusory than illuminating, and even readers who find Hardy unbearable would have to admit that he never leaves us feeling uninformed.</p><p>King is at her best with her portrayal of the teenage children forced together by their parents' inexplicable marriage. Vida's son is a particularly endearing character: "He would begin his life as a regular person," he thinks, "who ate his meals not in a cafeteria but in a kitchen." At the wedding reception, he can barely contain his excitement: "Tonight they'd go home to a regular house on a regular street, husband and wife in the master bedroom and four kids sprinkled in rooms down a hallway." In scenes that are funny, touching and sad, that naive hope is severely tested but not entirely crushed by the awkward integration with his new siblings, who view him and his mother as interlopers.</p><p>Unfortunately, the marriage at the center of the novel never attains the emotional substance of this side story involving the stepchildren. King is a wonderfully engaging writer who creates characters and situations we can't resist, but I kept raising my hand with questions about The English Teacher -- oh please, over here! -- until the bell rang and it was over. </p><p>Reviewed by Ron Charles <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p>Adult/High School-Vida Avery teaches literature at a New England prep school. She arrived at its doors 15 years earlier with her baby and a mysterious past. She is considered the best English teacher at Fayer Academy and she maintains rigid control of her classroom, tolerating no tangents, personal discussion, or questions. She tries to keep that same control over her life, which is why she shocks everyone, including herself, by marrying Tom Belou, a widower with three children. Her teenaged son, Peter, is thrilled to be moving from their quarters on the campus to a real house with a real family, but he finds that his stepsiblings are still grieving for their mother. His mother's closely guarded emotional world begins to unravel and she suffers a complete breakdown. The 1980 Iran Hostage Crisis provides the backdrop for the story, paralleling Vida's sense of being a captive in her marriage, but the stronger metaphor is Thomas Hardy's <i>Tess of the D'Urbervilles</i>, the tragic tale of an unwed mother, which Vida begins teaching the Monday after her wedding. Only when she reveals to Peter the truth about their past can any healing begin. King's engaging writing beautifully illuminates the complicated relationships and emotions of everyone involved. It is a story of isolation, patience, and love, and of people trying to find comfort in one another. The author's style is unsentimental and direct, and the compelling story draws readers right in.<i>-Susanne Bardelson, Kitsap Regional Library, WA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

VOLLMANN</b> is the author of ten novels, three collections of stories, and many volumes of non-fiction, including a seven-volume inquiry into whether and how violence may be justified, <i>Rising Up and Rising Down</i>, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. His novel <i>Europe Central</i> won the National Book Award in 2005. <i>Into the Forbidden Zone: A Trip Through Hell and High Water in Post-Earthquake Japan</i> was published last year by Byliner.

He lives in California.Just why a respected and talented young novelist like Vollman (Fathers and Crows, reviewed above, etc.) would want to publish dated jottings on a 1982 sojourn around and, briefly, in war-torn Afghanistan is anyone's guess. Whatever the reason, there's not much to commend in this digressive log, whose title alludes to a slide presentation the author mounted upon his return to northern California. In seemingly random fashion, Vollman recalls a journey taken to comprehend what had happened to the keystone Asian republic in the wake of its 1979 invasion by Soviet forces. Referring to himself as ``the Young Man'' throughout, the author provides a quasi-picaresque narrative of his travels in Pakistan and his short thrust with a mujihadeen band into Afghanistan itself. Vollman's protagonist is forever obliged to confront his own inadequacies following brief encounters with refugees, would-be warriors, corrupt bureaucrats, overworked officials, retired military men, out-of-office pols, and good-hearted citizens who go out of their way to make him feel welcome in their country. By the author's account, those whom the Young Man met in his travels invariably invested him with preternatural powers, owing to his American heritage. Whether Vollman intended to document the futility of trying to help others, or some other truth, is unclear. For all their purposeful irony, though, his short-take recollections add little to our understanding of a tragic chapter in world history. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The girls are sent to this high school perched on the ridge of the Nile in order to become the feminine elite of the country and to escape the dangers of the outside world. The book is a prelude to the Rwandan genocide and unfolds behind the closed doors of the school, in the interminable rainy season. Friendships, desires, hatred, political fights, incitation to racial violence, persecutions... The school soon becomes a fascinating existential microcosm of the true 1970s Rwanda.</p><p>� Born in Rwanda in 1956, Scholastique Mukasonga experienced from childhood the violence and humiliation of the ethnic conflicts that shook her country. In 1960, her family was displaced to the polluted and under-developed Bugesera district of Rwanda. Mukasonga was later forced to leave the school of social work in Butare and flee to Burundi. She settled in France in 1992, only two years before the brutal genocide of the Tutsi swept through Rwanda. In the aftermath, Mukasonga learned that 37 of her family members had been massacred. Twelve years later, Gallimard published her autobiographical account&nbsp;<i>Inyenzi ou les Cafards</i>, which marked Mukasonga's entry into literature. This was followed by the publication of&nbsp;<i>La femme aux pieds nus</i>&nbsp;in 2008 and&nbsp;<i>L'Iguifou</i>&nbsp;in 2010, both widely praised. Her first novel,&nbsp;<i>Notre-Dame du Nil</i>&nbsp;(<i>Our Lady of the Nile</i>), won the Ahamadou Kourouma prize and the Renaudot prize in 2012, as well as the Oc�ans France � prize in 2013 and the French Voices Award in 2014, and was shortlisted for the 2016 International Dublin Literary award.<br><br>&nbsp;� About the Translator: Melanie Mauthner read Modern Languages (French/Spanish) at Wadham College, Oxford and worked as a sociology lecturer before becoming a translator.

African francophone literature, and particularly that written by women, continues to be underrepresented in English, and as a result, we are not only missing out on compelling stories, but on an important political project. Scholastique Mukasonga, and likely many of her colleagues whom we have yet to translate, is working to correct the frustratingly persistent Western narratives about Africa and its history.

The brutality of the Hutu-Tutsi conflict is easily misunderstood. This book makes it human, brings it down to the level of the everyday. When the question of how such a thing could have happened is asked, the treacherous answer is here, in the mundane. By imagining the everyday lives of Rwandans, Mukasonga makes more sense of the climate leading up to the genocide than a stack of news articles does. From this slant, the novel does its work quietly and well, with its head down&#x2014;the way a Tutsi student might have done at Our Lady of the Nile." <b>- Bibi Deitz,&nbsp;<i>Bookforum</i></b></p><p>"The novel reflects glimpses of a tension-filled past and slowly moves to uncover racial strife and the increase of genocidal actions against the Tutsi minority in Rwanda through the eyes of lyc�e girls enrolled at a Catholic boarding school that stands isolated on the Ikibira mountaintop by the river Nile, gated and guarded." <b>&#x2014; <i>World Literature Today</i></b></p><p><br>"What makes Mukasonga&#x2019;s novel so effective is her ability to show how daily life continues alongside the omnipresent rhetoric of racial hatred and the threat of imminent violence ...&nbsp;Her novel is a portrait of the slow, excruciating build-up toward violence and Rwandans&#x2019; attempts to lead full, meaningful lives while contending with state-sponsored exclusion.

She lives in St. Louis, Missouri.</p><h2>My Mother&#39;s Secret: Based on a True Holocaust Story</h2><p>Franciszka and her daughter are unlikely heroines. They are simple people who don't stand out� that is, until there is a crisis. In 1939, the Nazis come to Poland and start to persecute the Jews. These are unreasonable times when providing shelter to a Jew has become a death sentence. Despite this, both Franciszka and her daughter hide Jewish families and a German soldier in their small home. For all of them to survive, she will have to outsmart the German commander and her neighbors.When you look at a piece of steel, can you tell whether it is the ordinary kind used to make forks and knives or whether it is the superstrength type used to construct bridges and high-rises? The honest answer is no. You cannot tell until you apply extreme pressure. People are like that.This story is a reminder that there are no profiles for courage and character, and that who we become is always a personal choice.This is my first book, but it feels like something that has been waiting for me for a while.I just had to be still enough to hear it. As the words flowed and formed, shaping ideas in their dance, it felt divine.Writing was a process far more intimate than I could have predicted. To be authentic and honest, it is your own life that you draw upon and so, telling a story reveals the truths that reside in your own heart.I loved creating this story. To be able to say that anything is possible if we connect with each other through kindness, understanding, and courage&#x201d;and to do it with reference to true events&#x201d;well, that was exhilarating.If this story somehow manages to touch you, if it somehow manages to remind you of your own humanity, then I will be incredibly happy.Living with gratitude,J.

You have no way of knowing any differently.</p><p>And so, I think that everyone is afraid of their father. I think that men marry to have someone cook and clean for them. I don&#x2019;t know that some men actually love their wives and their children.</p><p>My brother, Damian, and I grow up with two very different people.</p><p>My father is precise, hard, and linear, while my mother is imaginative, loving, and warm.</p><p>Both are strong.</p><p>My father is Ukrainian and my mother is Polish, but we moved to Germany, where the opportunities are better than in Poland.</p><p>My father is a machinist, and that suits him well because it requires precision and measurement&#x2014;both skills he possesses in abundance.</p><p>My mother works as a cook for a wealthy German family, and we love that she often brings leftovers home for us. She brings food that we never would have tasted otherwise. Not much usually, but there are sometimes small pieces of expensive meats like pork chops and, if we&#x2019;re lucky, fruits and nuts, which are luxuries for most people.</p><p>When there are leftovers, my mother puts them all on a plate for us to share. Even though we would have already eaten the dinner cooked ahead for us in the morning, it&#x2019;s a special treat that we all look forward to. Typically, my father gorges himself, reaching for more even while he&#x2019;s still chewing with his mouth partly open.</p><p>Once as I am about to pick up a slice of apple from the plate, my father slaps my hand. It is something that he wants.</p><p>My mother sees this and shakes her head. The next week she keeps a whole apple in her pocket and only brings it out after my father starts the loud, snorting sound that is his snore when asleep.</p><p>She cuts the apple in half and gives it to my brother and me.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know why, but I remember what happens next more than I remember how my father treats me. I can hear the words from my brother as if he has just said them: &#x201c;Lena,&#x201d; he says, using his nickname for me, &#x201c;you know I ate so much for dinner that I really don&#x2019;t want anything else. Why don&#x2019;t you have my half too?&#x201d;</p><p>I shake my head. &#x201c;You can eat this, Damian.&#x201d; But he refuses and makes me take it.</p><p>It makes the apple even sweeter than it already is.</p><p>My father, not having seen a trace of an apple for some time, asks, &#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you bringing home any apples, Franciszka?&#x201d;</p><p>My mother shrugs her shoulders and says, &#x201c;I work there; I don&#x2019;t shop there. I can only bring home what they give me.&#x201d;</p><p>My brother and I look at each other and then down because, if we didn&#x2019;t, he would have seen our smiles.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>TWO STRONG PEOPLE living together is not easy to begin with, but two strong people with opposing political views&#x2014;that&#x2019;s virtually impossible.</p><p>My father is a Nazi sympathizer, and my mother is horrified by it.</p><p>&#x201c;Hitler is the answer to the problems of the German people,&#x201d; my father says.</p><p>Just a few years ago no one had even heard of Hitler, but now it seems like his name is everywhere. His wave of popularity is swelling. People are poor and unemployment is high. Hitler promises better times. He tells the German people that they are superior.</p><p>&#x201c;Germany will be a great power again if Hitler is the leader,&#x201d; my father says. His fellow workers at the machine shop are all going to vote for him.</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re German and someone tells you that you&#x2019;re born superior, that would sound pretty good,&#x201d; my mother says.</p><p>&#x201c;Even better if the bad times are not your fault but caused by the Jewish people. It&#x2019;s so much easier than trying to explain it logically.&#x201d;</p><p>My mother doesn&#x2019;t pass judgment on groups of people. She believes in the individual.</p><p>&#x201c;Not all Germans are good or bad, and the same with Jews,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>She&#x2019;s outspoken and says what she believes.</p><p>They have shouting matches over this, and while my brother and I stay quiet, we don&#x2019;t like what Hitler is promising. We heard Hitler speak once and saw the hypnotic power that he had over people.</p><p>He has that effect on our father.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>MY FATHER DOESN&#x2019;T ARGUE WITH FACTS. He makes his points with attacks on the other person.</p><p>He doesn&#x2019;t fight fair.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you know about politics?&#x201d; he says to my mother. &#x201c;Cooking makes you smart, does it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t make you blind&#x201d; is what she says.</p><p>I think to myself, <i>I will never marry anyone like my father</i>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know if my mother ever loved my father.</p><p>Maybe love isn&#x2019;t something that people value when it&#x2019;s hard just to get by.</p><p>Damian and I are constantly worried that our father, so quick to anger, will strike her in one of their arguments.</p><p>Being slight and about half his size, my mother would be seriously injured.</p><p>She never backs down in their arguments, so it is my brother and I who fear.</p><p><i>We want to grow up so desperately.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>As predicted by my father, Hitler becomes chancellor on January 30, 1933.</p><p>Seven months later, a law is introduced to ban the formation of parties.</p><p>Now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there is no stopping the Nazi machine.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>It may have been as subtle as the sight of a small robin sitting on our windowsill in the early days of spring that makes my mother think, <i>This simple bird has the freedom to fly anywhere, and yet here we stay</i>.</p><p>Or maybe it&#x2019;s just what is practical. Leave when you have enough money set aside.</p><p>Regardless, one uneventful day, she tells my father that she has decided to move back to Poland. This is the same as saying she is leaving him because he has on many occasions said that he would never return to a country he felt was backward compared to Germany.</p><p>At this point, my brother is eighteen and I am two years younger, so we can make our own decision in terms of whom we will live with.</p><p>In reality, there&#x2019;s no decision to make.</p><p>We respect that she stands up to my father, who promises a secure lifestyle for obedience.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder if it&#x2019;s because we never felt close to our father that we embraced the values of our mother. It&#x2019;s hard to say how we become the people we do. My mother believes that it comes from our choices. She says, &#x201c;If you choose to do the right thing, it&#x2019;s a conscious decision at first. Then it becomes second nature. You don&#x2019;t have to think about what is right because doing the right thing becomes who you are, like a reflex. Your actions with time become your character.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you leave, don&#x2019;t come back,&#x201d; are my father&#x2019;s last words to us.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>We don&#x2019;t take much when we leave.</p><p>Fortunately, my mother has been smart enough to keep some of her earnings hidden from my father.</p><p>With her savings, my mother buys a small house with some land for raising chickens and growing vegetables in her hometown of Sokal, Poland.</p><p>Sokal is located a day&#x2019;s wagon ride from Warsaw. There&#x2019;s a river with majestic willow trees lining the banks that runs through town. In the summer, it has a carefree feel to it.</p><p>The people living here form three distinct communities: Ukrainian, Polish, and Jewish.</p><p>The Ukrainians don&#x2019;t trust the Poles, the Poles don&#x2019;t trust the Ukrainians, and they both don&#x2019;t trust the Jews. There exists a certain friction that has been dulled by time but is never gone.</p><p>A few wealthy families live in Sokal, but most of the people are of modest means. Just about everyone works hard for what they have.</p><p>The more expensive homes in town are made from bricks. However, the majority of people live in homes made from wooden boards that are considerably cheaper. Fireplaces are used to keep warm in the winter, when it can be mercilessly cold. It&#x2019;s not unusual for people to wear almost as much to keep warm indoors as outdoors in the coldest months.</p><p>For water, people go to a well that&#x2019;s in their neighborhood. Farmers sell their produce and meats in the market, where most people shop. Only those with money shop in the stores, which carry imported goods from Germany and other places.</p><p>At the market, my mother sells eggs from our chickens, and garden vegetables that she grows in season. My brother works at an oil refinery a few towns away, so we only see him on his days off. He brings supplies and takes care of us more than my father ever did.</p><p>When my brother comes to visit, the first thing he does is pick me up and whirl me around as if I were a small child. I am dizzy with this but love the feeling. Over six feet in height, he towers above me. I have to look up at him because I am barely taller than my five-foot mother.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how two plain-looking people like your father and I could have produced such attractive children,&#x201d; my mother says.</p><p>It seems we did inherit the best features from both our parents.</p><p>I have my father&#x2019;s brown eyes and chestnut hair, which flows with a natural wave hinting at its origin from his tight curls. My brother has my mother&#x2019;s fair skin and light hair, and I am envious of their gray, sparkling eyes.</p><p>Damian always brings me an apple when he comes to visit.</p><p>It&#x2019;s love and sacrifice disguised as a piece of fruit.</p><p>He brings my mother chewing tobacco, which she adores.</p><p>On my seventeenth birthday, Damian surprises me with an apple tree. &#x201c;Now you can have apples whenever you like, Lena. You don&#x2019;t have to wait for me anymore,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Show me where you want it planted.&#x201d;</p><p>I choose a spot just outside my window. It will be the first thing I see when I wake up.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t wait until I can earn money too. I want to surprise him with a present, and I already have something in mind.</p><p>There is a beautiful brown leather jacket in a store on the way to the market, which would be perfect for Damian.</p><p>I keep thinking to myself, <i>Please, please don&#x2019;t let anyone else buy it before I can get the money</i>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>In the local newspaper, there&#x2019;s an ad for a secretarial position, assisting the general manager of a garment factory in town. I confide to my mother that even though my chances are slim, I want to try. &#x201c;There are going to be so many girls competing for this job,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>She says to me, &#x201c;Do you remember when you first learned how to type? You wanted to be faster than anyone else in your class, but we didn&#x2019;t have a typewriter so you drew the keyboard on a piece of paper and practiced as if you were really typing. You always wanted to be the best, Helena, and you practiced day and night. Your teacher told me that she never had a student who could type eighty words a minute. You were the top in your class then, so why shouldn&#x2019;t you be selected for this job now? Besides, how many girls speak German as beautifully as you?&#x201d;</p><p>I already knew everything she was telling me, but there are times when it feels good to hear what you already know.</p><p></p></p><h2>Land Animals 1996 (Wonders of Science)</h2><p>New student workbook</p><p></p><h2>Augustine: Earlier Writings (The Library of Christian Classics)</h2><p><p>These are Augustine's writings from the time of his conversion to Christianity in AD 386 until he became Bishop of Hippo in 395-396.

He is a graduate of Pratt Institute and CCNY. He is the author of <i>Chinatown Beat</i>, <i>Year of the Dog</i>, <i>Red Jade</i>, and <i>Death Money</i>, also in the Detective Jack Yu series.It was a sunny morning, the second Monday in April, and NYPD detective Jack Yu quickened his pace, stepping briskly toward Confucius Towers with a takeout bag of <i>sooksik </i>food<i> </i>tins, a pack of illegal RedRockit firecrackers from Lee Bao&#x2019;s grocery, and a flask of whiskey.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also had a Colt revolver on his hip. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From late March through early April, with winter still hanging on, Chinatown barbecue shops were swamped from <i>hoy dong</i> opening until midafternoon, lines of the dutiful trailing out the door down along the sidewalk, folks pressing impatiently for the <i>char siew</i> and <i>for yook </i>and <i>see yow gai</i>. The triumvirate of Cantonese <i>sooksik </i>for Ch&#x2019;ing Ming observances&#x2014;roast pork, soy sauce chicken, barbecued spareribs <i>leung tew gwut</i> were the essential fast-food elements for a visit to the Chinese boneyard. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ch&#x2019;ing Ming was the Chinese memorial period when friends and relatives grave-sweep around headstones and burn death money, cash for expenses in the beyond. People were now said to be burning bigger denominations of death money since inflation hit the afterlife. <i>What</i>, Jack mused, <i>the paper Louis Vuitton handbags and the cardboard</i> <i>Mercedes cars weren&#x2019;t enough? </i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because they believe that underworld windows are temporarily open on the <i>other</i> side, families celebrate the spiritual connection and share the <i>sooksik</i> snacks like a communal picnic, spread out around the grave area. In rainy weather they eat standing under umbrellas, drinking from vacuum cartons of soy milk or chrysanthemum tea, sharing desserts like <i>bok tong go, wong</i> <i>tong go, dao foo fa</i>. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They pour <i>bok jo</i> wine into the earth, light candles and incense, and plant bouquets of flowers. Flower shops and Buddhist stores thrive during the Ch&#x2019;ing Ming period.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Easter around the corner</i>, Jack thought, and meanwhile a lot of <i>real</i> money being spent on death money and condos for the dead.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two main cemeteries for the New York City Chinese were in Brooklyn: Evergreen Hills and Cypress Valley. Many of the old-timers bought plots there when they realized they were never going back to China, but there were lots of Chinese in Queens now, farther from Chinatown, where they&#x2019;d bought up large sections of the Maple Grove and Flushing cemeteries. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pa was buried at Evergreen and it&#x2019;d been almost three months since Jack had last visited, in the dead of winter on Pa&#x2019;s birthday in January. That was the second time he&#x2019;d gone alone, without Alexandra, whose grandfather was also buried at Evergreen. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex had big problems of her own, a messy yuppie divorce that threatened to involve him. He remembered how it felt with her naked next to him. For a moment, he lost himself in the thought of it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d meant to visit the cemetery earlier, but a complicated Chinatown case had swallowed a couple of weekends, and the mental health day he&#x2019;d earned now came in handy. On the second Monday in April, he was already very late, toward the end of Ch&#x2019;ing Ming. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy Bow&#x2019;s Mustang made the going easier, and this late in the season on a weekday, he hadn&#x2019;t had to wait for the takeout. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Chinatown friend Billy Bow had embarked on a one-month sex tour of Thailand, to all the usual places&#x2014;Bangkok, Patpong, Chiang Mai&#x2014;and had generously loaned Jack his black 1986 Mustang GT, a nine-year-old souped-up and chromed gangsta ride with tinted windows. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mustang had been Billy&#x2019;s main ride before he got married, <i>cruisin&#x2019; his pimp an&#x2019;</i> <i>pussy mobile</i> he&#x2019;d called it, and after the ugly divorce, it reminded him how it felt to be free. He&#x2019;d loaned it to Jack under the condition that Jack left a full tank and returned it to its monthly parking spot at Confucius Towers. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy didn&#x2019;t want the car left on the streets overnight. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mustang was an automatic. It had a moonroof, power windows and locks, and a bumped-up stereo he&#x2019;d gotten from Canal Street. It was powered by a five-liter V-8 engine, and Billy had bartered for the mag wheels and chrome hubs, tinting the windows himself at Charlie Chang&#x2019;s chop shop on Pike and South. <i>Charlie took cash only, no receipt.</i> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car looked prime for a gangsta drive-by. The NYPD and DOT had outlawed the blacked-out windows, and cops harassed boom-box cars for noise violations, hoping for a bigger bust for weed or alcohol. It wasn't the kind of car you'd expect an Asian NYPD detective to step out of, unless he was undercover.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The incense and death money Jack needed were already in the black car&#x2019;s trunk, along with an empty five-gallon soya-oil tin can from the Tofu King. Billy had cut the metal top off to allow for the burning of the death money and to contain the exploding firecrackers. He&#x2019;d also included a plastic container of <i>bok tong go,</i> gelatinous sweets from the Tofu King. <i>For that lawyer</i> <i>chick of yours</i>, he&#x2019;d teased. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jack crossed the Bowery to the high-rise building and took the stairs down to the garage.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Paki attendant brought the Mustang up from the bowels of Confucius Towers Parking and got tipped a dollar. There were several attendants and Billy had explained to them about lending his car to his friend. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy had told them that Jack was a badass cop, and they always brought him the Mustang quickly and deferentially. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car growled like it needed to swallow some asphalt, and before Jack knew it, he was roaring down the expressway. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Driving the Mustang, Jack could get to Evergreen Hills in just twenty minutes. Traffic was light&#x2014;it was mostly heading in the opposite direction, into Manhattan&#x2014;and he switched up the radio from a rock station to some easy listening. He rolled his shoulders as the Mustang practically drove itself. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appointment with the NYPD therapist wasn&#x2019;t for another two hours, plenty of time to get to her office in lower Manhattan.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mellow music shifted his thoughts to Alex, <i>Alexandra Lee-Chow</i>, a passionate Chinatown lawyer with whom he&#x2019;d become intimately involved. Fleeting images of their nights together were crowded out by subsequent legal complications. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trouble was, her scummy soon-to-be-ex-husband had gotten his hands on a security videotape from Confucius Towers, a tape that captured him and Alex in the elevator going to and from her apartment in the Chinatown high-rise. <i>Proof of their movements in the wee hours.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tape would position Alex as an unfaithful wife, and because Jack was a tainted cop, would also show her as an unfit mother. Attendant lawsuits perforated the already acrimonious divorce proceedings, and Alex had broken off contact with Jack to protect her seven-year-old daughter. They&#x2019;d last met at a Lower East Side sushi bar. <i>Temporarily, </i>she&#x2019;d promised him, changing her cell-phone number, declaring that they couldn&#x2019;t be seen in public afterward. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He understood, knew she was protecting the custody case. But that was three weeks ago. And he missed her. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned off the radio as he arrived at the cemetery. It was peaceful. There weren&#x2019;t many visitors this late into the Ch&#x2019;ing Ming cycle. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He followed a serpentine road until he came to a knoll at the Chinese section along the edges of the cemetery. There was sparse green in the stands of trees and the earth was brown-gray and barren. He&#x2019;d planted a pair of Dusty Millers, bookending Pa&#x2019;s headstone. He wondered how they&#x2019;d survived the winter. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He parked the car, got his supplies, and headed toward the deserted knoll with its crooked lines of headstone tablets. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could almost hear Pa&#x2019;s complaint.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Come so late. Why come at all?</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He put down the bucket and bag. The branches of the Dusty Millers had withered somewhat but showed tiny buds of new life. He plucked away a few dead leaves. There would be yellow flowers in the coming weeks. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran his hand briefly over the headstone, over Pa&#x2019;s Chinese name carved into the rock, before gathering up branches that had fallen near the grave. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He kicked away twigs and pebbles and other winter debris, and when the site was clean he took the <i>sooksik</i> tins out and placed them on top of the plastic takeout bag. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took out his metal flask and poured a circle of XO into the earth at the base of the headstone. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Chaai lo ah?&#x201d;</i> he heard Pa&#x2019;s derisive words. &#x201c;Too busy arresting your own people?&#x201d; That conversation wasn&#x2019;t what he&#x2019;d come for, and he took a swig himself before pocketing the flask. Three months hadn&#x2019;t erased much of the guilt he still felt. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If anything needed to be swept clean, it wasn&#x2019;t the grave site. It was the grief in his heart from not having had the chance to say goodbye, make amends <i>son to father</i>. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The son, the cop. Always after the fact.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He fired up the incense. Now wasn&#x2019;t the time for apologies. He&#x2019;d offered plenty at the funeral, the Thirty Days After visit, Pa&#x2019;s birthday in January.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he presented the incense, he thought, <i>Yeah, Pa, sorry I&#x2019;m late. Yes, they&#x2019;ve got</i> <i>me arresting my own people, but only the bad ones</i>. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took a breath<i>. And I never take money. </i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took the first bow imagining his father&#x2019;s eyes on him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Today I remember and honor you.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bowed again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Today I sweep away all the dead things.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bowed lower for the third time and held it longer. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Today I burn death money to ease your way. </i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He planted the three sticks of incense at the head of the plot and readied the tin bucket at the foot of the grave. He flamed his lighter to the packs of death money and dropped some into the bucket. He fanned out the bigger denominations and fed the flames until the billions in death money was consumed. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the fire died out, he placed the <i>sooksik</i> on top of the headstone, the way Pa had taught him<i>. The dead are in the ground. Do you feed their heads or their feet?</i> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Feed your head, Pa</i>, he heard himself thinking. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He uncovered the tins and nibbled at the <i>cha siew</i> and the soy sauce chicken, imagining Pa having his fill of everything. Later, he&#x2019;d pack the leftovers and take them home. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grounds were barren, but the way the sun washed across the soft hills felt nurturing, ready for rebirth. He took another hard swig from the flask and lit up a cigarette. Poured the last of the whiskey into the ground. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost an hour had gone by and he took a final look at the skeletal branches of the Dusty Millers. Imagining them in full yellow bloom, he wondered if Pa would have approved. He packed up the leftover <i>sooksik</i> and stepped back to the foot of the grave. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took the pack of firecrackers from his pocket and put the tip of his cigarette to the fuse. Dropping it into the bucket, he offered a last bow.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Today I chase away the evil.</i><br> The explosions thundered inside the tin bucket and his ears pinged the same way they did on Chinese New Year, always a time of new beginnings. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He deposited the blackened bucket, with all the burned remains, into the cemetery&#x2019;s refuse bin.</p><h2>Tuck (King Raven)</h2><p>Abbot Hugo plans to bring the invading Norman marchogi to the forest in force, heralding the start of a campaign to wipe out King Raven and his band once and for all.

Rhi Bran is forced to masquerade as King Raven, aka Robin Hood, to elude the treacherous Abbot Hugo and Sheriff de Glanville. In doing so, he brings hope to the oppressed people of Wales and strikes terror in the hearts of the Norman invaders. Sound effects--the clashes of armor and swords, bloodcurdling screams, and horse&#39;s frightened snorts--all lend authenticity. Verner portrays short, stout Friar Tuck&#39;s witticisms--subtly humorous; his advice--wise beyond measure; his prayers--often answered; and his faithfulness to Robin--unwavering. Immersed in Celtic mythology, political intrigue, and exciting battle scenes and filled with memorable characters, TUCK is an unforgettable heroic tale.

The genius of Simply Ming is a versatile array of master recipes&#x2014;intensely flavored sauces, pestos, salsas, dressings, rubs, and more that eliminate much of the last-minute prep work. So sophisticated dishes such as Tea-Rubbed Salmon with Steamed Scallion-Lemon Rice, Grilled Miso-Citrus Scallop Lollipops, and Green Peppercorn Beef Tenderloin with Vinegar-Glazed Leeks can be on the table in less than 30 minutes.<br><br>Even casual dishes such as spaghetti, burgers, fried calamari, and chicken wings get a boost of East-West excitement in Ming&#x2019;s creative hands, becoming Asian Pesto Turkey Spaghetti, Salmon Burger with Tomato-Kaffir Lime Salsa, Blue Ginger Crispy Calamari, and Soy-Dijon Chicken Wings. This is food that is simple enough to serve on a weeknight, but special enough to share with guests. And desserts get the Simply Ming treatment, too, with tempting ways to transform basic shortbread dough, chocolate ganache, and cr�me anglaise into a range of show-stopping finales.<br><br>Filled with color photographs that motivate and inspire, beverage suggestions to complement each dish, and helpful tips for cooking with unfamiliar ingredients, <b>Simply Ming</b> makes the excitement and innovation of East-West cooking easily accessible to all home cooks.</p><p>You may want to put all your other cookbooks on waivers for a while and simply settle in to <i>Simply Ming</i> by Ming Tsai and Arthur Boehm. Tsai's the chef and owner of Blue Ginger in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and the host of Food Network's <i>East Meets West</i>. This particular book ties in with a show of the same title he's doing for public television.<p> Tsai has cut a wide swath through the food world with his creative blending of Eastern flavors and techniques with Western ingredients and presentations. Consider Asian Pesto Turkey Spaghetti, for example. This is Tsai-style spaghetti Bolognese, and it demonstrates the structure of the book. First comes the master recipe for Asian Pesto. Instead of basil, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil, and ground Romano--your classic pesto--Tsai calls for jalapeno chilies, garlic, sugar, ginger, macadamia nuts or salted peanuts, lemon zest, mint leaves, cilantro, salt and pepper, and basil and olive oil. For the Turkey Spaghetti you'll use ground turkey, red onion, button mushrooms, and white wine, as well as the Asian Pesto. In this particular chapter you'll also find recipes for Asian Pesto Chicken Salad, and Grilled Asian Pesto Shrimp and Radicchio.</p><p> This is a book about assembling major flavor statements ahead of time and storing them in the refrigerator. The actual cooking becomes a relatively rapid process while delivering maximum flavor. The sections in <i>Simply Ming</i> include Flavored Oils and Sauces; Sambals, Salsas, Chutneys, and Pastes; Dressings, Dipping Sauces, and Marinades: Syrups; Broths; Rubs and Coatings; Doughs and Desserts. </p><p> It's fast. It's flavorful. It's from both sides of the world. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>MING TSAI was named Best Chef of the Northeast by the James Beard Foundation in 2002.

As fully half of the human race dies off at a frightening pace and life on Earth faces extinction, panicked people and governments struggle to cope with the global crisis. Infected areas are quarantined or burned to the ground. The few surviving women are locked away in hidden reserves, while frantic doctors and scientists race to find a cure. Anarchy and violence consume the planet.<br><br>The plague is the work of a solitary individual who calls himself the Madman. As government security forces feverishly hunt for the renegade scientist, he wanders incognito through a world that will never be the same. Society, religion, and morality are all irrevocably transformed by the White Plague.</p><p><b>Frank Herbert</b> was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs--including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers--before becoming a full-time writer. He died in 1986.<i>May the hearthstone of hell be his bed rest forever!</i> <i>&#x2014;Old Irish Curse</i> <br> <br>It was an ordinary gray British Ford, the spartan economy model with right-hand drive customary in Ireland. John Roe O&#x2019;Neill would remember the driver&#x2019;s brown-sweatered right arm resting on the car&#x2019;s windowsill in the cloud-filtered light of that Dublin afternoon. A nightmare capsule of memory, it excluded everything else in the scene; just the car and that arm. Several other surviving witnesses commented on a crumpled break in the Ford&#x2019;s left front wing. The break had begun to rust. Speaking from her hospital bed, one witness said: &#x201c;The break was a jagged thing and I was afraid someone would be cut if they brushed against it.&#x201d; Two of those who recalled seeing the car come out of Lower Leeson Street knew the driver casually, but only from his days in postal uniform. He was Francis Bley, a retired postman working part-time as a watchman at a building site in Dun Laoghaire. Bley left for work early every Wednesday, giving himself time to run a few errands and then pick up his wife, Tessie. On that one day each week, Tessie spent the morning doing &#x201c;light secretarial&#x201d; for a betting shop in King Street. It was Tessie&#x2019;s habit to spend the rest of the day with her widowed sister who lived in a remodeled gatehouse off the Dun Laoghaire bypass &#x201c;just a few minutes out of his way.&#x201d; This was a Wednesday. May 20. Bley was on his way to pick up Tessie. The Ford&#x2019;s left front door, although appearing undamaged by the accident that had crumpled the wing, still required a twist of wire around the doorpost to keep it closed. The door rattled every time the car hit a bump. &#x201c;I heard it rattling when it turned onto St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green South,&#x201d; one&nbsp;witness said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s God&#x2019;s own mercy I wasn&#x2019;t at the Grafton corner when it happened.&#x201d; Bley turned right off St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green South, which put him on St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green West, hugging the left lane as he headed for Grafton Street. There were better routes for him to make his connection with Tessie, but this was &#x201c;his way.&#x201d; &#x201c;He liked to see all the people,&#x201d; Tessie said. &#x201c;God rest him, that&#x2019;s what he said he missed most when he quit the postal&#x2014;all the people.&#x201d; Bley, slight and wrinkled, had that skin-stretched cadaverous look that is common among certain aged Celts from the south of Ireland. He wore a soiled brown hat almost the exact shade of his patched sweater, and he drove with the patient detachment of someone who came this way often. And if the truth were known, he rather liked being slowed by the heavy traffic. It had been cold and wet through most of spring and, while it was still cloudy, the cloud cover had thinned and there was a feeling that there might be a break in the weather. Only a few of the pedestrians carried umbrellas. The trees of St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green on Bley&#x2019;s right were in full leaf. As the Ford inched along in the congested traffic, the man watching for it from a fourth-floor window of the Irish Film Society Building nodded once in satisfaction. <i>Right on time.</i> Bley&#x2019;s Ford had been selected because of this Wednesday punctuality. There was also the fact that Bley did not garage his car where he and Tessie lived in Davitt Road. The Ford was parked outside beside a thick yew hedge, which could be approached from the street along a path shielded by a parked van. There had been a van parked in this covering position the previous night. Neighbors had seen it but no one had thought to comment at the time. &#x201c;There were often vehicles parked in that place,&#x201d; one said. &#x201c;How were we to know?&#x201d; The watcher at the Film Society Building had many names but he had been born Joseph Leo Herity. He was a small, solidly fleshy man with a long, thin face and pale, almost translucent skin. Herity wore his blond hair combed straight back and hanging almost to the collar. His light brown eyes were deeply set and he had a pugged nose with prominent nostrils from which hair protruded. From his fourth-floor vantage, Herity commanded an overview of the entire setting for the drama he was about to ignite. Directly across from him, the tall trees of the green formed a verdant wall enclosing the flow of vehicles and pedestrians. The Robert Emmet statue stood opposite his window and, to the left of it, there was a black-on-white sign to the public toilets. Bley&#x2019;s Ford had stopped with the traffic just to the left of Herity&#x2019;s window. A&nbsp;white tour bus with blue-and-red stripes down its side loomed over the small Ford. Traffic fumes were thick even at the fourth-floor level. Herity checked Bley&#x2019;s license number to be certain.&nbsp; <i>Yes&#x2014;JIA-5028</i>. Then there was the crumpled left front wing. The traffic began to inch forward, then stopped once more. Herity glanced left at the Grafton Street corner. He could see the signs of the Toy World shop and the Irish Permanent Society on the ground floor of the red brick building soon to be taken over by the Ulster Bank. There had been some protest about that, one ragged march with a few signs, but it had died out quickly. The Ulster Bank had powerful friends in the government. <i>Barney and his lot,</i>&nbsp;Herity thought.&nbsp; <i>They think we&#x2019;re ignorant of their scheme to make a peace with the Ulster boys!</i> Again, Bley&#x2019;s Ford inched toward the corner, but once more was stopped. There was heavy foot traffic where Grafton took off from St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green. A bald-headed man in a dark blue suit had stopped almost directly beneath Herity&#x2019;s window and was examining the cinema marquee. Two young men pushing bicycles threaded their way past the bald-headed man. The traffic remained stopped. Herity looked down at the top of Bley&#x2019;s car. So innocent-looking, that car. Herity had been one of the two-man team to emerge from the yewshrouded van near Bley&#x2019;s parking spot the previous night. In Herity&#x2019;s hands had been a molded plastic package, which they had attached like a deformed limpet under Bley&#x2019;s car. At the core of that package lay a tiny radio receiver. The transmitter sat on the windowsill in front of Herity. A small black metal rectangle, it had a thin wire antenna and two recessed toggle switches&#x2014;one painted yellow, the other red. Yellow armed it, red transmitted. A glance at his wristwatch told Herity that they were already five minutes past Zero Time. Not Bley&#x2019;s fault. It was the blasted traffic. &#x201c;You can set your bloody watch by Bley,&#x201d; the leader of their selection team had said. &#x201c;The old bastard should be running a tram.&#x201d; &#x201c;What&#x2019;re his politics?&#x201d; Greaves had asked. &#x201c;Who cares about his politics?&#x201d; Herity had countered. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s perfect and he&#x2019;ll be dying for a grand cause.&#x201d; &#x201c;The street&#x2019;ll be full of people,&#x201d; Greaves had said. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;ll be tourists sure as hell is full of Brits.&#x201d; &#x201c;We warned&#x2019;em to stop the Ulster boys,&#x201d; Herity had said.&nbsp; <i>Greaves could be an old woman sometimes!</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;They know what to expect when they don&#x2019;t listen to us.&#x201d; It was settled then. And now Bley&#x2019;s car was inching once more toward the Grafton Street corner, toward the mass of pedestrians, including the possible tourists. John Roe O&#x2019;Neill, his wife, Mary, and their five-year-old twins, Kevin and Mairead, could have been classified as tourists, although John expected to be six months in Ireland while completing the research called for under his grant from the Pastermorn Foundation of New Haven, Conn. &#x201c;An Overview of Irish Genetic Research.&#x201d; He thought the title pompous, but it was only a cover. The real research was into the acceptance of the new genetics by a Roman Catholic society, whether such a society had taken a position to cope with the explosive potentials in molecular biology. The project was much on his mind that Wednesday morning but necessary preparations required his attention. High on his list was the need to transfer funds from America to the Allied Irish Bank. Mary wanted to go shopping for sweaters &#x201c;to keep our darlings warm of an evening.&#x201d; &#x201c;There y&#x2019; go,&#x201d; John teased as they left the Sherbourne Hotel, stepping into the rush of tourists and businessmen. &#x201c;Only four days in Ireland and already you sound like a local.&#x201d; &#x201c;And why not?&#x201d; she demanded. &#x201c;And both my grandmothers from Limerick.&#x201d; They laughed, drawing a few curious stares. The children tugged at Mary, anxious to be off shopping. Ireland suited Mary, John thought. She had pale clear skin and dark blue eyes. Jet-black hair&#x2014;&#x201c;Spanish Hair,&#x201d; her family called it&#x2014;framed her rather round face. A sweet face. Irish skin and Irish features. He bent and kissed her before leaving. It brought a blush to her face but she was pleased at his show of affection and she gave him a warm smile as they parted. John walked away briskly, humming to himself, amused when he recognized the tune: &#x201c;Oh What a Beautiful Mornin&#x2019;.&#x201d; John&#x2019;s Wednesday appointment for &#x201c;transfer of foreign funds&#x201d; was at two P.M. at the Allied Irish Bank, Grafton and Chatham streets. There was a sign just inside the bank&#x2019;s entrance, white letters on black: &#x201c;Non Branch Customers Upstairs.&#x201d; A uniformed guard led him up the stairs to the office of the bank manager, Charles Mulrain, a small, nervous man with tow-colored hair and pale blue eyes behind gold-framed glasses. Mulrain had a habit of touching the comers of his mouth with a forefinger, first left side then right, followed by a quick downward brush of his dark tie. He made a joke about having his office on the first floor, &#x201c;what you Americans call the second floor.&#x201d; &#x201c;It is confusing until you catch on,&#x201d; John agreed. &#x201c;Well!&#x201d; A quick touching of lips and tie. &#x201c;You understand that we&#x2019;d normally do this at our main office, but &#x2026;&#x201d; &#x201c;When I called, they assured me it was &#x2026;&#x201d; &#x201c;As a convenience to the customer,&#x201d; Mulrain said. He lifted a folder from his desk, glanced inside it, nodded. &#x201c;Yes, this amount &#x2026; if you&#x2019;ll make&nbsp;yourself comfortable here, I&#x2019;ll just get the proper forms and be right back.&#x201d; Mulrain left, giving John a tight smile at the door. John went to the window and pulled back a heavy lace curtain to look down on Grafton Street. The sidewalks were thick with people all the way up to the arched gateway into St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green two short blocks up Grafton. The motor traffic was two abreast filling the street and crawling along toward him. There was a workman cleaning the parapet on the roof of the shopping center diagonally across the street&#x2014;a white-coated figure with a long-handled brush. He stood outlined against a row of five chimney pots. Glancing at the closed door of the manager&#x2019;s office, John wondered how long Mulrain would be. Everything was so damned formal here. John looked at his watch. Mary would arrive with the children in a few minutes. They planned to have tea, then John would walk down Grafton to Trinity College and begin work at the college library&#x2014;the real start of his research project. Much later, John would look back on those few minutes at the bank manager&#x2019;s &#x201c;first-floor&#x201d; window and think how another sequence of events had been set in motion without his knowledge, an inescapable thing like a movie. film where one frame followed another without ever the chance to deviate. It all centered around Francis Bley&#x2019;s.old car and a small VHF transmitter in the hands of a determined man watching from an open window that looked down on that corner where Grafton met St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green. Bley, patient as always, eased along at the traffic&#x2019;s pace. Herity, in his window vantage point, toggled the arming switch of his transmitter, making sure the antenna wire dangled out over the sill. As he neared the Grafton corner, the crush of pedestrians forced Bley to stop and he missed the turn of the traffic light. He heard the tour bus gain clear of traffic off to his right, trundling off in a rumble of its heavy diesel. Barricades were being erected on the building to his left and a big white-onred sign had been raised over the rough construction: &#x201c;This Building to be Remodeled by G. Tottenham Sons, Ltd.&#x201d; Bley looked to his right and noted the tall blue-and-white Prestige Cafeteria sign, feeling a small pang of hunger. The pedestrian isthmus beside him was jammed with people waiting to cross over to St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green and others struggling to make a way through the cars stopped on Grafton and blocking Bley&#x2019;s path. The crush of pedestrians was particularly heavy around Bley&#x2019;s car, people passing both front and back. A woman in a brown tweed coat, a white parcel clutched under her right elbow and each hand grasping a hand off a small child, hesitated at the right front corner of Bley&#x2019;s car while she sought an opening through the press of people. John Roe O&#x2019;Neill, standing at the bank manager&#x2019;s window, recognized Mary. He saw her first because of her familiar tweed coat and the way she carried her head, that sleek cap of jet hair. He smiled. The twins were&nbsp;screened from him by the hurrying adults but he knew from Mary&#x2019;s stance that she held the children&#x2019;s hands. A brief break in the throng allowed John a glimpse of the top of Kevin&#x2019;s head and the old Ford with the driver&#x2019;s brown-sweatered elbow protruding. <i>Where is that damned bank manager?</i>&nbsp;John wondered.&nbsp; <i>She&#x2019;ll be here any minute</i>. He dropped the heavy lace curtain and looked once more at his wristwatch. Herity, at the open window above and behind Bley, nodded once more to himself. He stepped back away from the window and toggled the second switch on his transmitter. Bley&#x2019;s car exploded, ripped apart from the bottom. The bomb, exploding almost under Bley&#x2019;s feet, drove him upward with a large piece of the car&#x2019;s roof, his body crushed, dismembered and scattered. The large section of roof sailed upward in a slow arc to come crashing onto the Irish Permanent Society Building, demolishing chimney pots and slates. It was not a large bomb as such things went, but it had been expertly placed. The old car was transformed into jagged bits of metal and glass&#x2014;an orange ball of fire peppered with deadly shrapnel. A section of the car&#x2019;s bonnet decapitated Mary O&#x2019;Neill. The twins became part of a bloody puddle blown against the iron fencing across the street at St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green. Their bodies were more easily identified later because they were the only children of that age in the throng. Herity did not pause to glance out at his work; the sound told it all. He tucked the transmitter into a small and worn military green pack, stuffed an old yellow sweater onto it, strapped the cover and slung the pack over his shoulder. He left the building by the back way, elated and satisfied. Barney and his group would get this message! John O&#x2019;Neill had looked up from his wristwatch just in time to see the orange blast envelop Mary. He was saved from the window&#x2019;s shattered glass by the heavy curtains, which deflected all but one of the shards away from him. One small section of glass creased his scalp. The shock wave staggered him, driving him backward against a desk. He fell sideways, momentarily unconscious but getting quickly to his knees as the bank manager rushed into the room, shouting: &#x201c;Good God! What was that?&#x201d; John stumbled to his feet, rejecting the question and the answer that rumbled through his head like an aftershock of the blast. He brushed past the bank manager and out the door. His mind remained in shock but his body found its way down the stairs. He shouldered a woman aside at the foot of the stairs and lurched out onto the street where he allowed himself to be carried along by the crowd rushing toward the area of the blast. There was a smell of burnt iron in the air and the sound of cries and screams. Within only a few seconds John was part of a crush being held back by police and uninjured civilians pressed into service to keep the area around the explosion clear. John elbowed and clawed his way forward. &#x201c;My wife!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;I saw her. She was there.

His gutsy, take-no-prisoners interviews and commentary on the Fox News Channel's <em>Hannity &amp; Colmes</em> have made him one of cable television's most popular personalities. And his ascendance to the top of the talk radio world with ABC Radio's <em>The Sean Hannity Show</em> has won him a huge and devoted following that includes not only conservatives but anyone else who values straight talk over pandering and excuses.</p><p>Now, in <em>Let Freedom Ring,</em> Sean Hannity offers a survey of the world&#x2014;political, social, and cultural&#x2014;as he sees it. Devoting special attention to 9/11, the war on terror, and the continuing threat we face at home and abroad, he makes clear that the greatest challenge we have to overcome may not be an attack from overseas, but the slow compromising of our national character. And he asks why, particularly in this time of war, should we entrust our future to the voices of the Left&#x2014;the very people who have spent decades ravaging so many of our core values and traditions?</p><p>Our nation, as Hannity reminds us, was founded on the idea of freedom. And in order to protect our freedoms, he argues, we must stand vigilant against liberal attempts to compromise our strengths. From our military and intelligence forces, to our borders and airports, to our unified commitment to root out terrorists at home and abroad, he reveals how our strongest lines of defense have come under attack&#x2014;by left-wing voices within our government, media, schools, and elsewhere. And he shows how even domestic issues like taxation, education, patriotism, and the family have been exploited by liberals with their own agendas&#x2014;with potentially disastrous results.</p><p>Filled with the commonsense commentary and passionate argument that have made Sean Hannity the most compelling conservative voice since Rush Limbaugh, <em>Let Freedom Ring</em> is an urgent call to arms.

Like Limbaugh, he has strongly conservative political views and forceful communication skills. As host of a radio show on WCBS in New York and co-host of a program on Fox News, Hannity has an excellent sense of how his audience hears his words. While that can be seen in this work, the production seems more like highlights from radio broadcasts than the reading of a formal text. Throughout the work, he reads comfortably and conversationally.

Description: In the 1950s, after penning his Future History stories-what would become his most famous series, Robots and Foundation-Isaac Asimov published his first three novels, the classic works that make up this exclusive SFBC omnibus. Set thousands of years after a nuclear holocaust ravaged the Earth, the Empire novels trace the Grand Master&#39;s vision of mankind&#39;s first halting steps toward galactic civilization and the birth of the first Galactic Empire. The Stars, Like Dust: A native of one of the backward planets conquered by the cruel Tyranni Empire, Biron Farrill is only days away from graduating from the University of Earth when someone tries to murder him in his sleep. The attack is part of a Tyranni plot to eliminate all resistance leaders, one of whom had been his own father. Now Biron has been chosen to step into his father&#39;s shoes and rally the rebellion. But once he casts his lot with the freedom fighters, he will find himself guarding against treachery on every side and facing the most difficult choice of his young life: to betray either the woman he loves or the revolution his father died to protect. The Currents of Space: Thousands of years after the events of The Stars, Like Dust, a man named Rik is wiped of his mind and deposited on the planet Florina-a wimpering, thumb-sucking half-child. Valona, a lonely peasant girl, adopts and takes care of him, and slowly his memory returns. But what he remembers entangles the pair in a web of interplanetary intrigue, in which they&#39;re hunted by high-ranking officials and spies. For what Rik knows about the future could topple an empire.</p><p></p><h2>Maigret and the Calame Report/ (Variant Title = Maigret and the Minister) (English and French Edition)</h2><p>Inspector Maigret becomes a reluctant advisor to a cabinet minister, involved in political intrigue</p><p>Georges Simenon (1903-1989) was born in Lie`ge, Belgium.

Announcing the official movie tie-in edition of Mark Frost+s award-winning The Greatest Game Ever PlayedThe riveting tale of one of golf+s most defining moments comes to life on-screen this fall from Walt Disney Pictures+and is sure to spark renewed interest in Mark Frost+s sensational book of the same name.The movie The Greatest Game Ever Played is directed by Bill Paxton and stars Shia LaBeouf (I, Robot), Stephen Dillane (King Arthur, The Hours), Peter Firth (Pearl Harbor), Elias Koteas, and Peyton List. It will be released in September +05 from Walt Disney Pictures.</p><p><strong>Mark Frost</strong> is the author of the critically acclaimed THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED, THE GRAND SLAM, and the bestselling THE LIST of 7, THE 6 MESSIAHS, and BEFORE I WAKE. He received a Writer's Guild Award and an Emmy nomination for his work as executive story editor on the acclaimed television series <i>Hill Street</i><i> Blues</i>, and was the co-creator and executive producer of the ABC television series <i>Twin Peaks</i>. He lives in Los Angeles and upstate New York.*Starred Review* The story of Francis Ouimet, the first amateur to win the U.S. Open golf tournament, is just too good to be true: it's <i>Rocky</i> without the sequels, it's Jack without his beanstalk, it's Tiger without Nike. But it's true, and as told by veteran thriller writer Frost, it's the most compelling sports book since Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling <i>Seabiscuit</i>. Born in 1893, Ouimet grew up poor, directly across the street from The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, where Boston's blue bloods tried their hands at the new sport of golf. The game caught young Francis in its grip, and despite his father's disapproval, he became a caddie at the club and taught himself to play. Frost jumps between Ouimet's story and the surprisingly similar saga of British champion Harry Vardon, who was also born poor and contended with a disapproving father. Frost builds his characters--not just Ouimet and Vardon but also Francis' caddy, 10-year-old Eddie Lowery--with the skill of a novelist (occasionally but believably using invented dialogue). The climax of the narrative--the recounting of the 1913 U.S. Open at Brookline, where the unheralded, 20-year-old Ouimet beat both his idol Vardon and the other reigning British professional, Ted Ray--is genuinely exciting, a marvelous re-creation of a signature moment in golf history. Underdog stories have become among the sappiest cliches in pop-culture's arsenal, but this one reminds us why they worked in the first place. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But his troubles are not over: the temptation to slip is constant (thanks to his enabling, ever-partying mom, Maggie). He's being stalked by David, his mom's ex--a preppy, khaki-wearing psycho with a proclivity for rib-breaking. And Maggie, a witch as well as a badass, can't protect him like she used to because he's moved from Kitimat to Vancouver for school. <br> He figures that in order to be safe from both magic, addiction and David, he's got to get his grades up, find a job that doesn't involve selling weed cookies, and learn how to live with his Aunt Mave, who has been estranged from the family ever since she tried to "rescue" him as a baby from his mother. Though she smothers him with hugs, Mave is blind to the real dangers that lurk around them--the spirits and supernatural activity that fill her apartment.<br> As the son of a Trickster, Jared is a magnet for magic, whether he hates it or not. He sees ghosts, he sees the monster moving underneath his Aunt Georgina's skin, he sees the creature that comes out of his bedroom wall and creepily wants to suck his toes. He also still hears his father in his head, and other voices too. When David finally catches up with him, Jared can't ignore his true nature any longer. And neither can anyone else he loves.</p><p>Haisla/Heiltsuk novelist EDEN ROBINSON is the author of a collection of short stories written when she was a Goth called <i>Traplines</i>, which won the Winifred Holtby Prize in the UK. Her two previous novels, <i>Monkey Beach</i> and <i>Blood Sports</i>, were written before she discovered she was gluten-intolerant and tend to be quite grim, the latter being especially gruesome because half-way through writing the manuscript, Robinson gave up a two-pack-a-day cigarette habit and the more she suffered, the more her characters suffered. <i>Monkey Beach </i>won the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize and was a finalist for the Giller Prize and the Governor General's Award for Fiction. <i>Son of a Trickster</i>, the first instalment of her Trickster trilogy, was a finalist for the Scotiabank Giller Prize. In 2017, she won the Writers' Trust of Canada Fellowship. She lives in Kitimat, BC.The clouds finally broke into a sullen drizzle after a muggy, overcast day. Jared Martin flipped up his hood as he turned the corner onto his street. His mom&#x2019;s truck was in the driveway. The house he&#x2019;d grown up in was two storeys high, white with green trim. The large porch was littered with work gear. His mom rented out two of the rooms and the basement to pay the bills. Most of her tenants were sub-subcontractors, in Kitimat for a few weeks and unwilling to shell out for a pricey furnished one-bedroom or a motel room. Or they were hard-core smokers who wanted to be able to light up in their rooms and found a kindred spirit in his mom, a dedicated two-packer who hated being forced outside. <br><br> He paused on the sidewalk, listening. Things seemed quiet. Which didn&#x2019;t mean it was safe to go in, but Jared went up the steps and opened the front door. Not visiting his mom before he took off for Vancouver would save him a lot of grief, but it would be such a douche move. She&#x2019;d never let him forget it. <br><br> &#x201c;Mom?&#x201d; Jared said.<br><br> &#x201c;In here,&#x201d; she said, her voice coming from the kitchen. <br> &nbsp;<br> The kitchen windows were all open and moths fluttered against the screens. She was frying a pan of meatballs, her cigarette tucked into the corner of her mouth. <br><br> Her hair was in a ponytail. She wore her favourite ripped Metallica T-shirt over jeans and flip-flops. He could see all the little muscles working in her face as she inhaled. She was losing weight again. He hoped it was just coke. <br><br> Jared put his backpack down by the table and then hopped up to sit on the counter. His mom salted a pot of boiling water and cracked in some spaghetti.<br><br> &#x201c;Nice of you to show up,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> Jared swung his feet, staring down at them. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Richie?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He is where he is.&#x201d;<br><br> Her boyfriend sold the lighter recreational drugs. They used to get along, but Richie seemed suspicious of Jared now that Jared was sober, like he had suddenly turned into a narc. When they were forced together by his mom, Richie wouldn&#x2019;t talk to him for fear of incriminating himself.<br><br> Jared watched her resentfully making him dinner. She hated cooking. He wished she&#x2019;d just ordered a pizza. He tried to think of a safe topic of conversation. His Monday night shift at Dairy Queen was normally dull, but his new co-worker had kept stopping to sob into her headset. &#x201c;Work was nuts. I had to train my replacement. She does not handle stress well.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not many people survive the soft-serve ice-cream racket.&#x201d;<br><br> Ball-buster, his dad called her when he was being charitable. His adoptive dad? His dad. Philip Martin, the guy who had raised him when his biological dad turned out to be a complete dick.<br><br> She stirred the pasta. &#x201c;What? No snappy comeback?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, looking down on all us alkies and addicts must be exhaust�ing.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are we going to do this all night?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Get the colander.&#x201d;<br><br> Jared hopped down and grabbed the colander from the cupboard above the fridge. <br><br> When he handed it to her, she stared at him a moment. Then her lips went thin, the lines around her mouth deepening. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you staying with Death Threat,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> Death Threat was the nickname of one of her exes, Charles Redhill, a low-level pot grower who said it would be okay if Jared bunked in his basement while he was going to school in Vancouver, if he didn&#x2019;t mind working a little security detail in exchange. <br><br> &#x201c;People aren&#x2019;t exactly lining up to let me sleep on their couches,&#x201d; Jared said. <br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a fuckboy with delusions he&#x2019;s Brando.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Stel-la!&#x201d; Jared said, trying to make her laugh. <br><br> She ignored him as if he wasn&#x2019;t standing beside her. She took the cigarette out of the corner of her mouth and let the pasta drain in the colander in the sink and then dumped it back in the pot. She poured in a jar of Rag� spaghetti sauce and stirred and then added the meatballs. She crushed the last bit of her cigarette out on the burner and tossed the butt in a sand-filled coffee can near the sink. He carried the pot to the table. She pulled some garlic bread out of the oven. <br><br> They ate in silence. Or, more accurately, Jared ate in silence. His mom smoked and picked at a meatball with her fork, slowly mashing it into bits.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Death Threat&#x2019;s place?&#x201d; she said. <br><br> Jared shrugged. He was hoping against hope that Death lived near his school, the British Columbia Institute of Technology. Didn&#x2019;t matter, though. Nothing beat free.<br><br> &#x201c;Nice. I&#x2019;m your mother and you don&#x2019;t trust me enough to know where you&#x2019;re fucking staying.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s away in Washington State right now. I&#x2019;m booked at a hos�tel for the first week. Just text my cell.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He told you where he lives, right?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll show.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a fucking pothead. He&#x2019;ll forget you exist. He forgets where his ass is until someone hands it to him.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I can handle myself.&#x201d;<br><br> His mom sucked in a great impatient breath. <br><br> &#x201c;Can we just have a nice supper?&#x201d; Jared said. <br><br> &#x201c;Can you not live with the spazzy fucktard who calls himself Death Threat?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Chill, okay? I just need a free place until my student loan comes in, then I&#x2019;ll find a room or something.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Buttfucking Jesus on goddamn crutches.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Mom.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t <i>Mom </i>me, genius. This is a crap plan.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my life,&#x201d; Jared said, pushing the plate away. <br><br> &#x201c;Jared, you can barely manage warding. What&#x2019;re you going to do if you run into something really fucking dangerous?&#x201d;<br><br> His mom was a witch. For real. As he had found out definitively, just before he swore off the booze and the drugs. He&#x2019;d always thought she was being melodramatic when she told him witch stuff. Then he was kidnapped by some angry otters and his shape-shifting father/<br> sperm donor stepped in to save him, along with his mother. He only lost a toe. Her particular talent was hexes, though she preferred giv�ing her enemies a good old-fashioned shit-kicking. Curses tended to bite you in the ass, she&#x2019;d told him, and weren&#x2019;t nearly as satisfying as physically throttling someone. <br><br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s going to bother me?&#x201d; Jared said. &#x201c;I got nothing anyone wants.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the son of a Trickster,&#x201d; she hissed.<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a billion of us.&#x201d; On one website he&#x2019;d found 532 people claiming to be the children of Wee&#x2019;git. Either Wee&#x2019;git couldn&#x2019;t keep it in his pants or a lot of people wanted to appear more exotic. <br><br> &#x201c;You think you&#x2019;re so fucking smart,&#x201d; his mom said.<br><br> Jared recited the Serenity Prayer in his head. She shook another cigarette out of the pack and lit it off her butt before crushing it out on the full ashtray in the middle of the table. The TV went on in the living room. The recliner squealed. <br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be out of your hair tomorrow,&#x201d; Jared said. &#x201c;You can forget you ever had me and party yourself to death.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You are testing my patience.&#x201d; <br><br> It was always a bad sign when his mom stopped swearing. Jared focused on the tick of the kitchen clock to stay calm. <br><br> &#x201c;You think I don&#x2019;t love you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Is that it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m high on your priority list.&#x201d;<br><br> She got up and stood over him. She took her cigarette out of her mouth and he half-expected to get it in his face. He must have flinched, because her eyes narrowed dangerously. <br><br> She grabbed his chin. &#x201c;You shoulda been a girl. <i>Wah. Mommy doesn&#x2019;t fucking love me. My feelings. My feeeeeelings</i>.&#x201d;<br><br> He shoved her hand away. &#x201c;Get off me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are we done emoting?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I am.&#x201d;<br><br> She backed up a step. &#x201c;So I asked my sister if you could stay with her.&#x201d;<br><br> Holy crap. Jared was stunned. His mom hadn&#x2019;t spoken to her sis�ter since . . . forever. God. She really didn&#x2019;t want him to stay with Death Threat. <br><br> &#x201c;I dunno,&#x201d; Jared said. <br><br> &#x201c;Mave&#x2019;s willing to put you up,&#x201d; his mom said. &#x201c;But be careful. She&#x2019;s deaf to magic. Don&#x2019;t bring it up around her. She&#x2019;ll think you&#x2019;re nuts and try to get you on antipsychotics.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I thought you hated her.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br><br> She took a piece of paper out of her jean pocket and handed it to him. His throat tightened when he saw the name and number. His aunt, Mavis Moody, had tried to get custody of him when he was a baby, figuring her sister would be bad for any baby. His mom had married Philip Martin to avoid losing Jared. He couldn&#x2019;t meet his mom&#x2019;s eyes knowing how much of her pride she&#x2019;d sacrificed to find him a safer place to crash. He dropped his head. <br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say I never did anything for you,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> Jared reached down, rifled through his backpack and gave her his grad picture. <br><br> She frowned. &#x201c;Are you throwing it in my face? I only have grade eight and you&#x2019;re a fucking high school graduate? You think that makes you special?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a picture,&#x201d; Jared said. &#x201c;Toss it if you don&#x2019;t like it.&#x201d;</p><h2>INSIDE OUT - JUNIOR</h2><p><b><i>Inside Out: The Junior Novelization</i>&nbsp;is the paperback retelling of the hit movie!<br></b>Disney/Pixar&#x2019;s <i>Inside Out</i> takes you to a place that everyone knows but no one has ever seen: inside the human mind! <i>Inside Out: The Junior Novelization</i> retells the whole exciting story and features eight pages of full-color scenes from the movie.</p><p></p><h2>Father Peyton&#39;s Rosary Prayer Book</h2><p><p></p><p>The most complete prayer book of meditations on the mysteries of the Rosary today.

He is responsible for bringing Hole, Pavement, Soundgarden, and a host of other bands to international attention. He introduced Kurt Cobain to Courtney Love, performed on stage with Nirvana on numerous occasions, and famously pushed Kurt onto the stage of the Reading Festival in 1992 in a wheelchair. <i>Nirvana: The Biography</i> is an honest, moving, incisive, and heartfelt re-evaluation of a band that has been misrepresented time and time again since its tragic demise in April 1994 following Kurt Cobain's suicide. True captures what the band was really like. He also discusses the music scene of the time-the fellow bands, the scenes, the seminars, the countless live dates, the friends and allies and drug dealers. Drawn from hundreds of original interviews, <i>Nirvana: The Biography</i> is the final word on Nirvana, Cobain, and Seattle grunge.</p><p><b>Everett True</b> is a music journalist and the author of biographies of the Ramones, the White Stripes, Supergrass, and many others. He lives in Brighton, England.True's history of the superstar 1990s band gets off to a rough start when he invokes the "live fast, die young" clich� and declares, "Kurt Cobain left one of the best-looking corpses around," perhaps not the most tasteful epitaph given the singer' s shotgun suicide. Subsequent chapters on Cobain' s early years are bogged down with interviews with just about anyone who ever met him, many with little apparent editing from the original transcripts. Fortunately, the pace picks up as Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl join the band, and the trio rocket to fame. True trades heavily on his role as one of the first music journalists to write about the Seattle scene, as well as his status as Cobain's "drunken English buddy" and an ambiguously close relationship with Courtney Love (he also takes credit for introducing the two to each other). His insider perspective, combined with a tighter control over the interview selection, brings thoughtful insight to Cobain's dramatic crash-and-burn. Yet though largely respectful, True is somewhat ambivalent, questioning the extent of Cobain's talent and openly wondering if Nirvana had any real influence on rock. His opinionated, idiosyncratic take on the band is sure to set tongues wagging and respark the debate over how things went so wrong for Cobain so fast. 32 pages of photos. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The transplanted Yorkshireman's pictures capture Southern California's pools, palms and play with deadpan seriousness. This album lets the reader decide whether Hockney's paintings, collages and prints are more than the febrile imaginings of a slick eclectic. His grid-like composite photographs attempt to convey "lived time"; in jaunty set designs and costumes for The Rake's Progress, The Magic Flute and Tristan und Isolde, he rummages through the vast terrain of art history. All the media in which Hockney has worked are amply represented here, yet overall his output has come to look monotonous and lightweight. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.British-born Hockney has had an international impact, and this book is a rich evocation of his 30-year career. Besides fellow artist R.B. Kitaj's overview, the book contains essays by Henry Geldzahler, Christopher Knight, Gert Schiff, Anne Hoy, Kenneth Silver, and Lawrence Weschler. This varied perspective is insightful, even startlingly intimateand in an unusual tribute to Hockney's stature as a painter, printmaker, and designer of contemporary angst, he is given the last 24 pages to make an artistic statement about the medium of creative work via commercial reproduction. This successful retrospective is recommended for all specialized art collections, particularly because of the evaluative essays, and is a fine acquisition for general libraries as well. Paula A.

Freedom in America has decreased over the last century and seems to be diminishing more rapidly as time goes on. Many are concerned for the future of the nation and wonder where things went wrong and how to repair the damage. In the book 1913, Oliver DeMille answers these questions by illuminating three critical events of 1913 which, combined with a corresponding event in 1936, constituted a Turning Point away from freedom and by detailing three practical solutions for restoring America&#x2019;s freedom and revitalizing her prosperity. With the implementation of these solutions, the future of America is still very bright.</p></p><p><p>Oliver DeMille is a founder of The Center for Social Leadership, and the author of 1913, A Thomas Jefferson Education, FreedomShift, among others.

He and his wife Rachel are raising their 8 children in southern Utah.</p></p><h2>Swimming Home</h2><p>Swimming Home is a subversive page-turner, a merciless gaze at the insidious harm that depression can have on apparently stable, well-turned-out people. Set in a summer villa, the story is tautly structured, taking place over a single week in which a group of beautiful, flawed tourists in the French Riviera come loose at the seams. Deborah Levy&#39;s writing combines linguistic virtuosity, technical brilliance and a strong sense of what it means to be alive. Swimming Home represents a new direction for a major writer. In this book, the wildness and the danger are all the more powerful for resting just beneath the surface. With its deep psychology, biting humour and deceptively light surface, it wears its darkness lightly.</p><p>Deborah Levy is an author, playwright and poet. Her fiction includes two Man Booker Prize shortlisted novels, Swimming Home (2011) and Hot Milk (2016), as well as Black Vodka (2013), shortlisted for the Frank O&#39;Connor International Short Story Award.&#39;Swimming Home is as sharp as a wasp sting ... Witty and poignant, its pages melt away like an unsettling yet familiar dream.&#39; Sunday Times ---------- &#39;Deborah Levy has made something strange and new ... spiky and unsettling. In this novel, home is elusive, safety is unlikely, and the reader closes the book both satisfied and unnerved.&#39; The Guardian ---------- &#39;A stealthily devastating book ... Levy manipulates light and shadow with artfulness. She transfixes the reader: we recognize the thing of darkness in us all. This is an intelligent, pulsating literary beast.&#39; The Telegraph ---------- &#39;Swimming Home is a beautiful, delicate book underpinned by a complexity that only reveals itself slowly to the reader.&#39; Financial Times ---------- &#39;This amazing novel is a haunting exploration of loss and longing. It has an epic quality.&#39; The Independent ---------- &#39;A statement on the power of the unsaid. Magisterial ... Themes, phrases and images recur in rhythmic cycles through this fugal novel. Levy&#39;s cinematic clarity and momentum convey confusion with remarkable lucidity.&#39; Times Literary Supplement ---------- &#39;As the reader is drawn beneath the placid surface of her characters&#39; experiences, Levy reveals a more urgent world humming with symbols.&#39; Literary Review ---------- &#39;Exquisite ... Levy&#39;s sense of dramatic form, as she hastens us toward the grim finale, is unerring, and her prose effortlessly summons people and landscapes.&#39; New Yorker ---------- &#39;Readers will have to resist the temptation to hurry up in order to find out what happens ... Our reward is the enjoyable, if unsettling, experience of being pitched into the deep waters of Levy&#39;s wry, accomplished novel.&#39; New York Times ---------- &#39;Elegant ... subtle ... uncanny... The seductive pleasure of Levy&#39;s prose stems from its layered brilliance.&#39; Washington Post ---------- &#39;Here is an excellent story, told with the subtlety and menacing tension of a veteran playwright.&#39; Wall Street Journal</p><h2>Australia&#x2019;s Secret War: How Unions Sabotaged Our Troops in World War I I</h2><p>Hal Colebatch&#39;s new book, Australia&#39;s Secret War, tells the shocking, true, but until now largely suppressed and hidden story of the war waged from 1939 to 1945 by a number of key Australian trade unions against their own society and against the men and women of their own country&#39;s fighting forces at the time of its gravest peril. His conclusions are based on a broad range of sources, from letters and first-person interviews between the author and ex-servicemen to official and unofficial documents from the archives of World War II. Between 1939 and 1945 virtually every major Australian warship, including at different times its entire force of cruisers, was targeted by strikes, go-slows and sabo�tage. Australian soldiers operating in New Guinea and the Pacific Islands went without food, radio equipment and munitions, and Aus�tralian warships sailed to and from combat zones without ammunition, because of strikes at home. Planned rescue missions for Australian prisoners-of-war in Borneo were abandoned because wharf strikes left rescuers without heavy weapons. Officers had to restrain Australian and American troops from killing striking trade unionists.

That's easy: "A bar, and enough money and clout to run it." It's time for Jake to save the day yet again, with a lot of help from the rest of his pun-happy, cosmically strange crew. And no more kiddie stakes like in the previous Callahan books, when mere humanity was on the line. Nope, Jake needs to save the totality of the universe. From, of all things, the quest for knowledge. What does that mean? Well, it's got something to do with a classified satellite called the Deathstar, a hurricane named Erin, a superenergetic cosmic ray in the wrong place at the wrong time, the Soviet space station Mir, and a shamelessly enormous volume of Irish coffee. But as any Callahan fan will duly attest, all of this is really beside the point.<p> Books in this series (this one included) showcase the M�nchhausen-style storytelling skills of Nebula- and Hugo-winner Spider Robinson. Putting one of cinema's most robust tropes into service--calling the team back together, � la <i>Oceans 11</i>--and doing a bang-up job at it as usual, Robinson should please old fans and win new ones. If nothing else, you'll surely come to love the eclectic cast of dozens, including everybody from a talking baby (Jake's teleporting, superhacker daughter) to a talking German shepherd (Ralph Von Wau Wau) to--why not?--the forgotten father of the 20th century, Nikola Tesla. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Nobody blends good science with bad puns as brilliantly as Spider Robinson, as his legion of devoted fans will attest.

A plump Vietnamese-American teenager is sent to her elderly grandmother in Ho Chi Minh City to lose weight, only to be lured out of the house by the wafting aroma of freshly baked bread.

You know I can&#x2019;t eat papaya. It makes my stomach hurt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tck! It goes in the trash can then. Such a waste.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait! Why can&#x2019;t you eat it? Or feed it to Grandpa?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Grandpa and I are sick of it&#x2014;�we&#x2019;ve eaten nothing but &#x111;u &#x111;&#x1ee7; for two straight days because I bought six from that Chinese grocer out in Bellaire last week and now they&#x2019;re starting to go bad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ha! Why did you buy so many?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was hoping for visitors to share them with. But no one comes to see me. Everyone is too busy&#x2014;�so American! Always working, working, and no time for Grandma. Not even your mother stopped by this week. And the only reason you&#x2019;re here is a silly high school project.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right, all right. But I&#x2019;m only gonna eat a bit, okay? Just this little piece right here. And then we&#x2019;ll do the interview . . . Oh God, it&#x2019;s so slimy . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wonderful! Yes, chew, chew&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to tell me to chew!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s disgusting to speak with your mouth full, con. Chew, chew. Swallow! See, that wasn&#x2019;t so bad, was it? And it will make your hair shiny and give you good skin. Have another piece.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My stomach feels weird already, Grandma. But I&#x2019;ll have one more piece while you talk, deal?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, making deals now, hah? And I thought you weren&#x2019;t sneaky like the other grandchildren. You&#x2019;ll start gambling next. What kind of story did you want me to tell you, con?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m after the big one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh dear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Leaving Vietnam. The boat journey. That&#x2019;s what I want to write about.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ask your mother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I did, but she was too young when it happened. She only remembers the refugee camp and arriving in Houston.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ask your father then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He came over on a plane in the eighties, and that&#x2019;s not half as exciting. That&#x2019;ll get me a B if I&#x2019;m lucky. But your boat person story? Jackpot. Communists! Thai pirates! Starvation! That&#x2019;s an A-�plus story.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, is that what it is?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mom said you don&#x2019;t like talking about the war, but I should know about my past, shouldn&#x2019;t I? That&#x2019;s what this school project is about&#x2014;�learning your history, exploring your culture, discovering where you came from, that kind of thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You really want to know the country you came from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you want a story about me on a boat?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine. I will tell you a boat story. It begins on a stormy day at sea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait, wait! Let me get my pencil . . . Okay, go!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The waves were vicious, the wind was an animal, and the sky was dung-�colored.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hang on a second. Where were you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On the boat, of course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well yeah, but is this 1975? We are talking about 1975, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Child, when you&#x2019;re my age you don&#x2019;t bother remembering years.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But this is at the very end of the war?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did that war ever really end, con?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Look, Grandma, I just need to get the dates straight! How old were you then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Around the same age as you; I married young. Perhaps a couple years older.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re getting confused. If Mom was seven when she left, you had to have been way older than sixteen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly. I remember everything perfectly. This was the day after my wedding. My hair was long and shiny&#x2014;�it was all the &#x111;u &#x111;&#x1ee7; I ate growing up, I&#x2019;m telling you, con&#x2014;�and my teeth weren&#x2019;t bad; they said I could&#x2019;ve made a better match than a fisherman. But I did not care about money. Even though we were poor, at the wedding I wore a silk dress embroidered with flowers, and gold earrings that my mother-�in-�law gave me. After the ceremony I gathered my belongings in a bag and moved onto Grandpa&#x2019;s sampan.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, we&#x2019;re definitely not on the same page . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quiet, con, you asked for my boat story, so now listen to me tell it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your grandpa spent our first night as husband and wife throwing up the two bottles of rice wine he drank at the wedding reception. In the morning his head was foggy, so he untied the boat and steered us out to sea without paying attention to the signs: the taste of the wind, the shape of the clouds, the strange way the birds were flying. He cast his nets but kept drawing them back empty, and so we drifted farther and farther from land. By the time he noticed how strong the waves were, we could no longer see the shore.<br><br>&#x201c;The storm began, rain drilling down on us as we crouched together beneath a ratty tarp. Our poor sampan bounced on the water like a child&#x2019;s toy. Waves sloshed over the sides, slapping me in the face, the salt burning my nostrils. When our tarp was torn away with a scream of wind, Grandpa and I dug our fingernails into the floorboards of the boat, even though we knew it would do no good in the end.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;When we are thrown into the water, cling to my back,&#x2019; Grandpa shouted, mostly to hide his fear. &#x2018;I will swim us home.&#x2019; His breath was still stale with rice wine.<br><br>&#x201c;But this boat is our home, I thought. I looked out over the waves that I knew would soon swallow us up. Then to my surprise, I saw a small dark shape bobbing off in the distance. I wiped my eyes and looked again&#x2014;�it was coming toward us. &#x2018;Another boat!&#x2019; I cried out, overjoyed, thinking we would be rescued after all. Grandpa braced himself against the side of the hull and stood up, waving his arms and yelling as loud as he could. I grabbed on to his feet to keep him from toppling overboard, and together we waited to be saved.<br><br>&#x201c;But as we watched, we realized that the thing approaching us was not a boat after all. I blinked and squinted, not wanting to believe my eyes, hoping that the rain was blurring my vision. Grandpa stopped waving and went silent, his face puzzled at first, then terrified.<br><br>&#x201c;It was a man, not a boat. He was walking upright over the water&#x2014;�I swear it on my mother&#x2019;s dirt grave in Ha Tinh&#x2014;�staggering across the sea as if it was just unruly land. Perhaps I cannot say that it was a man, for it was clear that he was long dead, and from the looks of it had met his end by drowning; the body was bloated and the flesh that hadn&#x2019;t already been eaten by fishes was a terrible greenish-�black color. The chest had been torn wide open, and I could see ribbons of kelp threaded among the white bones of its rib cage. Whatever spirit had reanimated the corpse must have been a feeble one, for the body moved clumsily, legs stiff but head dangling loose as it struggled to keep its balance on the angry waves. Grandpa sank down to his knees next to me, and we peered over the gunwale in helpless horror as the body tottered closer and closer.<br><br>&#x201c;When there were only a few feet of churning black ocean left between it and our boat, the corpse stopped. It swayed before us like a drunk man&#x2014;�and for some reason it stood on tiptoe, the decomposing feet arched like a dancer&#x2019;s&#x2014;�dipping and rising with us on each wave but never breaking the skin of the water.<br><br>&#x201c;Grandpa and I waited for the body to move. To talk. To pounce on us. But it simply stood there. I felt it was watching us even though its eye sockets were empty&#x2014;�for the face is where the fish nibble first, you know. We crouched in the boat until our knees hurt, all the while under the sightless gaze of this unnatural thing. Grandpa would have vomited in fright had his stomach not already been empty from throwing up all night. Eventually I couldn&#x2019;t take it anymore; if I was going to die, I wanted to get it over with.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Spirit!&#x2019; I called out, my voice so small against the storm. &#x2018;What is it that you want?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x201c;The drowned man&#x2019;s head flopped down to one side and it turned its rotting palms out to me, as if to show that it didn&#x2019;t know, either.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;My husband and I have nothing to give you; no rice or incense to make an offering with. We do not know how to lay you to rest.&#x2019; A wave slopped over the side of the boat and I received a mouthful of salt water. I spat it out and continued. &#x2018;We are just two wet and weary souls, like you.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have to shout these last words, for the wind had begun to quiet down. The rain was no longer beating on my skull and the back of my neck.<br><br>&#x201c;With the jerky movements of a puppet on strings, the corpse lifted its head once more and bent its knees. It had no eyes, no lips or cheeks, and there was only a little bony ridge where the nose had been, yet it still looked sad. Poor thing: lost, half-�eaten, and a little too alive to be completely dead. It spun on its tiptoes, then began wandering away across the waves once more. Grandpa thought it went south, and I was sure it went west, though we were probably both wrong, for we were still dazed by the storm. It did not turn to look back at us, and after a while we couldn&#x2019;t see it any longer.<br><br>&#x201c;The waves were far from calm and the sky too dark for us to be optimistic, but Grandpa began steering us toward what we hoped was the shore. When we finally made it back to land we were shaking, but not for the reasons you might think. It wasn&#x2019;t that thing we had met out on the water that frightened us, but the fact that we had gotten away so easily. Because what we suspected then was that there would be a price to pay later. I look at it this way: On that stormy day the spirits did not take us, but they wrote our names down in their book, and we knew they would eventually come collecting.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Grandma! What the hell was that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Watch your mouth, con.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seriously, if Mom heard you talking like that, she&#x2019;d think you were losing it and send you right to an old folks&#x2019; home!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, now you know why I never tell your mother any of my stories.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What am I supposed to do with a story like that? I&#x2019;m going to fail history! And your papaya is giving me a stomachache!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Con, if you were listening you would have learned almost everything you need to know about your history. The first rule of the country we come from is that it always gives you what you ask for, but never exactly what you want.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I want the real story!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was a real story. All of my stories are real.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No! You know what I mean, I know you do! Why can&#x2019;t you tell me how you escaped?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s simple, child: Did we ever really escape?&#x201d;<br><br>BOAT STORY<br><br>&#x201c;Here, con, I cut up a &#x111;u &#x111;&#x1ee7; just for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh no, Grandma, I&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very ripe!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gra&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And very good for you too!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Grandma!

Centennial Award for 100th published novel.<br><br><em>Queens Crossing, Louisiana</em><br><br>Nola Landry was out-of-her-head sick with a three-day fever and had lost all track of time.<br><br>It had begun raining the day before she got sick, and it was still raining the next morning when the aches and fever began. She'd gone to sleep with the sound of rain on the roof and dreamed crazy, fever-ridden dreams about alligators in the front yard and her daddy shooting at them from the porch. Then she woke up remembering Daddy had died when she was twelve.<br><br>She fell back asleep to the sound of rain blowing against the windows and dreamed Mama was calling her to breakfast and she was going to be late for school, and when she woke up, it was dark and she remembered Mama had died just before Christmas last year.<br><br>She crawled out of bed long enough to go to the bathroom and get a drink, then fell back into bed. Her long dark hair had lost the band keeping it in a ponytail, and was damp and in tangles from the fever that came and went. After soaking her last clean nightgown from a fever-drenched sweat, she'd crawled back into bed nude.<br><br>The last thing she remembered as she was falling asleep was wondering how long it would take someone to find her body if she died.<br><br>Sometime later, another dream began, and in it Mama was running through the house, going from window to window and wringing her hands when all of a sudden, she began calling Nola's name.<br><br><em>Nola! Nola! Wake up this instant! Put on your clothes! Get some food and water and get out! Hurry, hurry! You have to run!</em><br><br>Nola woke with a gasp, looking around her darkened bedroom in feverish confusion. She knew her mother was dead, but the urge to obey was so strong that she threw back the covers, turned on the lamp beside her bed and began to dress. She grabbed a pair of jeans and a T-shirt, then pulled a hooded sweatshirt on over that. Her hands were trembling, her legs shaking as she sat down to tie her tennis shoes. The urgency to obey was increasing as she dropped her cell phone in a pocket.<br><br>She went through her house, stumbling on shaky legs, then into the kitchen, muttering to herself.<br><br>"Get food and water.. food and water."<br><br>She grabbed a bottle of water, a few sticks of string cheese and a package of peanut butter crackers, and put them in the front pouch of the sweatshirt and started toward the door.<br><br>"Car keys...gotta get my car keys."<br><br>She found the keys on the coffee table and was still moving on instinct when she opened the front door. Even though it was dark, she sensed something was wrong. She was all the way out onto the porch before she realized she was walking in water. Her heart skipped a beat as she backtracked to the kitchen for a flashlight.<br><br>Her hands were still shaking as she went back to the porch and swung the flashlight out into the night. It took a few seconds to recognize what she was seeing, and then, when she did, she was struck by pure, unadulterated fear.<br><br>There was nothing but black water as far as she could see.<br><br>The flashlight beam was weak, but the horror was real as she stepped off the porch into the rain to test the depth. When it went up past her ankles, she had to face the fact that her car keys would do her no good. The only road out would already be underwater.<br><br>While she had slept, the Mississippi River, which was nearly a half mile from her house, had gone out of its banks. She didn't question what she'd been dreaming because her mama had just saved her life. Her reality now was the need to get to high ground.<br><br>She looked back once at her beloved home, thinking of all she was about to lose: her studio, the half-finished paintings she was working on and the ones ready to ship, all of her brushes and paints, and the contacts she'd spent years accumulating.<br><br>When she thought of the family keepsakes and the pictures of her loved ones since passed on that would be washed away, she had to accept that none of it mattered if she lost her life with it.<br><br>The thought popped into her head that she could climb on top of the house and wait to be rescued, but the moment she thought it, she dismissed it. Mama had said run. So she ran through the rain toward the highest point of ground within striking distance: a stand of trees nearly a hundred yards away.<br><br>Slogging through the steadily moving water was exhausting, but fear gave her strength. When something live suddenly bumped against her leg she screamed, remembering that the gators would be flooded out, as well, but whatever it was moved past her.<br><br>In a moment of gratitude for the danger that had passed, Nola leaned forward, bracing her hands against her knees to steady her racing heart.<br><br>"God, help me do this," she said softly, her heart pounding as she made herself take that next step.<br><br>She was halfway between the house and the trees when she stepped into a hole and fell forward, catching herself on her hands and knees, and splashing water all over her face. Again she thought of the gators, snakes and snapping turtles that would be in there with her, and she scrambled to her feet and, in a panic, began running.<br><br>The next time she fell she lost the flashlight in the water and spent precious seconds feeling for it in the murky depths. When her fingers finally curled around the metal shaft, she grabbed it. By the grace of God the light was still shining, but she had no idea how long it would last. She swept the beam across the darkness, caught a flash of contrast in the distance when the light swept past the trees, and kept on moving.<br><br>The water was getting deeper now, almost up to her knees. The sweeping force of the flow made it difficult to stay upright. The urgency to get out of the water was paramount as she finally reached the grove. Sheltered somewhat from the downpour, she began trying to find the tallest, strongest tree she could physically climb, and just as she settled on one, the flashlight began to dim.<br><br>Without waiting, she swung herself up on the lowest limb just as the flashlight went out. Groaning with dismay, she had no choice but to drop it into the flood, grab the limb with both hands and begin climbing, feeling her way in the dark with the rain hammering against her face and the roar of the rushing water loud in her ears. She reached for the next limb, and then the next, climbing until she found a branch strong enough to hold her weight and managed to pull herself up, then straddle it. Exhausted, she wrapped her arms around the trunk, laid her cheek against the bark and screamed through the downpour just to hear the sound of her own voice. Just to remind herself she was still breathing.<br><br>When dawn broke in the east, Nola's clothes were soaked and she was exhausted. But daylight brought hope. It was no longer raining, and her fever had broken. She was weak, but what the hell. Things could be worse.<br><br>Twice during the night she'd had to climb higher to stay out of the water, and she was again straddling a limb and hugging the trunk. Her skin was raw from the abrasion of the bark, and the palms of her hands were bleeding from holding on so tight.<br><br>New horror came with daylight when she looked back at where her house once stood and realized it was gone. Either it was underwater or had washed off the foundation and moved past her in the night. Her vision blurred as she quickly looked away. No need dwelling on what she'd lost. Unless she got rescued, the issue was moot.<br><br>She looked down into the dark churning water below her, then out through the branches to the vast expanse of flooded land, and gasped. The water was rife with the remnants of people's lives, like the boiling stew in a witch's cauldron with its eye of newt, a goblin's ear and the scale from a fire-breathing dragon. This cauldron had pieces of houses swept from their foundations, bloated animal carcasses and uprooted trees, all caught up in the floating debris, all rushing downriver at a breakneck pace.<br><br>Her heart was pounding so hard she couldn't think, her hands shaking so badly it was difficult to hold on. It finally occurred to her that part of this was her body's cry for sustenance, and she remembered the food and water.<br><br>She found the phone as she was digging in her pocket for the food and felt a few moments of relief, thinking she would soon be rescued. She'd completely forgotten she had it. Her hands were shaking as she took it out, and as she did, water ran out of the case and down her arm.<br><br>The sight sent her into a new wave of despair. She was sobbing as she tried desperately to get a signal, moving it in every direction, but it was obvious the phone was dead, water-soaked and beyond repair. She dropped it in the water and leaned her forehead against the tree. Her face felt hot. Her eyes were burning, which meant her fever was back up. Scared and shaky, she dissolved into tears as the runaway river rolled on beneath her feet. When she managed to get herself together, she finally ate some cheese and drank some of the water, wishing time would move as fast as the water rushing past her. But the law of physics was impervious to the Mississippi flood, and so she closed her eyes, held on to the tree and focused her thoughts on happier days.<br><br><em>She was sitting in Granny's lap on a hot summer night, listening to the bullfrogs croak and the night birds calling while Granny was putting her to sleep. The soft, low-country drawl of the old woman's voice was soothing to a little girl's heart.</em><br><br><em>"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want... "</em><br><br><em>Creak, creak, creak, went the rocker as it rocked against the loose boards in the porch.</em><br><br><em>"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside still waters."</em><br><br>Nola sobbed. Where, God? Where are those still waters now?<br><br><em>Creak, creak, creak. Still rocking. Still listening as the verses spilled out of Granny's mouth as easy as honey in a spoon. Still feeling the strength and the love in Granny's work-worn hands.</em><br><br><em>"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies."</em><br><br><em>"Granny?"</em><br><br><em>"What baby?"</em><br><br><em>"Why are we feeding the enemy?"</em><br><br><em>Granny's laugh rolled through Nola like wind through the trees.</em><br><br><em>"Close your eyes, baby girl, and just listen."</em><br><br><em>Creak, creak, creak, went the rocker on the same loose board. The last thing Nola heard before the Sandman took her under was Granny's voice.</em><br><br><em>"Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me..."</em><br><br>It was the loud crack, and then the sound of a big tree dying as the roots gave way that woke Nola up with a start. She looked down just as a tree from the grove fell into the flood with a tremendous splash. She watched in horror as it hit and bounced, making waves large enough to reach up within feet of where she was sitting. Then it was pulled into the current and became part of the debris floating downriver.<br><br>She threw back her head and screamed, both in fright and in rage, wondering how long it would be before her tree went down and took <em>her</em> under, too.<br><br>As the river continued to rise, she was forced yet again, to climb to a higher limb. But once she'd reached that height, it became apparent she was not the only one stranded in this location.<br><br>The Lewis family were her nearest neighbors. Their house was across the road and about a hundred yards upriver, normally hidden from view by trees. Only now the trees were gone and Nola had a clear view of the house, which was nearly submerged. Only the very top part of the roof was visible, and the occupants&#x2014;Whit and Candy Lewis, and Candy's mother, Ruth Andrews&#x2014;were on it and clinging to each other, just feet away from being washed off and into the flood.<br><br>Horrified by the sight, Nola started to call out to them, but then decided it would serve no purpose. She was just as stranded as they were, and just as likely to drown. She hugged the trunk a little tighter and once again, let her thoughts drift to the past.<br><br>Out of nowhere, Tate Benton's face popped into her mind. She used to love to look at him. From an artist's perspective he had a most interesting face: a broad forehead, high cheekbones that angled down toward a very stubborn chin, with a nose that was in perfect proportion to his other features&#x2014;perfect except for that bump from breaking it in the eleventh grade. He'd grown to well over six feet before his sixteenth birthday. It had taken him until his second year in college to grow muscles to fit that height. By then he was a man, both in physical strength and attitude. He'd known from a young age that he wanted to be in law enforcement, and they had planned all the way through college to go back to Queens Crossing to begin their life together.<br><br>Then, one night just after they had graduated college, he came to her house in a panic and told her he was leaving. He begged her to go with him but wouldn't tell her what was wrong. She kept begging him to stay, to explain what had happened, but he wouldn't. They fought. He walked out, and she never heard from him again. Without an understanding of what was wrong there was nothing to hold them together, and he disappeared from her life.<br><br>She wondered if he was married, and if he would feel bad when he heard they'd pulled her body out of the river. Then she told herself it was the fever making her think crazy. Screw Tate Benton. She didn't want to think about him anymore, but when she closed her eyes, the first thing she saw was his face and the way his eyes crinkled up at the corners when he was laughing. Because he'd lived in town, he'd always loved to come out to her place to go fishing. He had a fishing pole, and she had her sketch pad. He fished while she drew him over and over and over. She still had those sketch pads somewhere.<br><br>And then she looked out across the water and remembered she didn't have anything anymore. The river had taken it away, just like it was trying to take her. She climbed a branch higher, struggling to stay awake by drinking more of the water and eating. She ate another piece of cheese and one of the peanut butter crackers, then had to move because her legs were so numb from hanging down she could no longer feel her feet.<br><br></p><h2>Garro (42) (The Horus Heresy)</h2><p>Battle-Captain Garro, a legendary hero of the Horus Heresy, finally emerges from the shadows.<br><br>Clad all in grey, an errant warrior of the Legiones Astartes kneels before the Regent of Terra and accepts a solemn new duty &#x2013; Battle-Captain Nathaniel Garro, once commander of the Eisenstein, is now Agentia Primus of Malcador the Sigillite.

Desperaux, the plucky little mouse who won the 2004 Newbery Medal, lived a life of high adventure. Christopher, "the small traveler," lives in neither a castle nor a dungeon, and there are no princesses around. But even without the fairy-tale trappings, his quest is no less full of daring, lessons, and hope. Christopher starts his story in a manner reminiscent of Dickens: "My life began in the most commonplace way. I was born in an ordinary wire cage, on a soft bed of paper shavings." While still in their cage, Christopher's mother teaches her son and his siblings how to find a good owner in the pet shop for which they are destined, how to read, and even how to escape a home if need be. As it turns out, all these skills are necessary. Author Wise moves Christopher from one home to the next with ease and humor, punctuating the many everyday incidents with the actions of a dangerous a cat, a nefarious boy, and a young taxidermist. The writing is nicely mannered but very accessible, making the book not only a winner for reading aloud but also a delightful offering for children moving past beginning readers.

Not down a sleepy residential street like McLean. If it had just turned in from Route 79&#x2014;known in Freehold, New Jersey, as South Street&#x2014;it would have been going even more slowly, since no seven-ton truck could round a 90-degree corner at a fast clip. But the truck had the height and breadth to all but fill the side road and sweep the other cars, bikes, and pedestrians to the side until it grumbled past. Assuming the other folks were paying attention to the road ahead.<br> <br>The five-year-old girl on the tricycle had other things on her mind. She might have been racing her friend to the Lewis Oil gas station on the corner. Or maybe she was simply a child at play, feeling the spring in the air on a late afternoon in April 1927.<br> <br>Either way, Virginia Springsteen didn&#x2019;t see the truck coming. If she heard the driver&#x2019;s panicked honk when she veered into the road, she didn&#x2019;t have time to react. The driver stomped hard on the brakes, but by then it didn&#x2019;t matter. He heard, and felt, a terrible thump. Alerted by the screams of the neighbors, the girl&#x2019;s parents rushed outside and found their little daughter unconscious but still breathing, They rushed her first to the office of Dr. George G. Reynolds, then to Long Branch Hospital, more than thirty minutes east of Freehold. And that&#x2019;s where Virginia Springsteen died.<br> <br>The mourning began immediately. Family members, friends, and neighbors streamed to the little house on Randolph Street to comfort the girl&#x2019;s parents. Fred Springsteen, a twenty-seven-year-old technician at the Freehold Electrical Shop downtown, kept his hands in his pockets and spoke quietly. But his twenty-eight-year-old wife, Alice, could not contain herself. Hair frazzled and eyes veined by grief, she sat helplessly as her body clutched with sobs. She could barely look at Virginia&#x2019;s toddler brother, Douglas. The boy&#x2019;s father couldn&#x2019;t be much help either, given the pall of his own mourning and the overwhelming needs of his distraught wife. So in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy virtually all of the care and feeding of the twenty-month-old boy fell to Alice&#x2019;s sisters, Anna and Jane. Eventually the others eased back into their ordinary lives. But the approach and passing of summer did nothing to ease Alice&#x2019;s grief.<br> <br>She could take no comfort in the clutching arms of her small son. Nearing his second birthday in August the boy grew dirty and scrawny enough to require an intervention. Alice&#x2019;s sisters came to gather his clothes, crib, and toys and took the toddler to live with his aunt Jane Cashion and her family until his parents were well enough to care for him again. Two to three years passed before Alice and Fred asked to be reunited with their son. He went home soon afterward, but Virginia&#x2019;s spirit continued to hover in Alice&#x2019;s vision. When Alice gazed at her son, she always seemed to be seeing something else; the absence of the one thing she had loved the most and lost so heedlessly.<br> <br>A semblance of family structure restored, the Springsteen home still ran according to its residents&#x2019; imprecise sense of reality. No longer employed by the Freehold Electrical Shop, Fred worked at home, sifting through mountains of abandoned electronics in order to repair or build radios he would later sell to the migrant farmworkers camped on the fringe of town. Alice, who never worked, moved according to her internal currents. If she didn&#x2019;t feel like getting up in the morning, she didn&#x2019;t. If Doug didn&#x2019;t want to go to school in the morning, she let him stay in bed. Cleaning and home repair ceased to be priorities. The walls shed curls of paint. The plastered kitchen ceiling fell off in chunks. With a single kerosene burner to heat the entire house, winters inside were Siberian. For Douglas, whose DNA came richly entwined with darker threads, the peeling wallpaper and crumbling windowsills framed his growing sense of life and the world. No matter where he was, no matter what he was doing, he would always be looking out through the fractured windows of 87 Randolph Street.<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>Doug Springsteen grew to be a shy but spirited teenager matriculating at Freehold High School. He loved baseball, especially when he was with his first cousin and best friend, Dave &#x201c;Dim&#x201d; Cashion, an ace pitcher and first baseman. Cashion was already considered one of the best players to ever emerge from Freehold. Off the diamond, the cousins passed the hours shooting pool at the small game rooms tucked between the stores, barbershops, and news stores clustering Freehold&#x2019;s central intersection at South and Main Streets. Cashion, who was seven years Doug&#x2019;s senior, launched his baseball career just after leaving school in 1936. He spent the next five years working his way from the local amateur and semipro leagues all the way into the major league farm system. He got there just in time for World War II to shutter the leagues and redirect him into the US Army.<br> <br>Raised by parents for whom education amounted to a long distraction from real life, Doug quit his studies at Freehold Regional after his freshman year ended in 1941, taking an entry-level job as a bottom-rung laborer (his official title was creel boy) in Freehold&#x2019;s thriving Karagheusian rug mill. He kept that job until June 1943, when his eighteenth birthday made him eligible to join the army. Shipped to Europe in the midst of the war, Doug drove an equipment truck. Back in Freehold following the war&#x2019;s conclusion in 1945, Doug took it easy and lived off the $20 in veteran&#x2019;s pay he received from the government each month.<br> <br>As Fred and Alice made clear, academic and professional ambition were not priorities, if only because of their absolute disinterest in achievement&#x2014;to say nothing of books, culture, or anything that gestured beyond the here-and-now. So if Doug wanted to live in their house and slouch through his life, that suited them perfectly. He was, after all, his parents&#x2019; child.<br> <br>Doug barely made a gesture toward adult life until his cousin Ann Cashion (Dim&#x2019;s younger sister) came by offering a night out. She had a friend named Adele Zerilli he might like to meet. So how about a double date? Doug shrugged and said sure. A few nights later the foursome were sitting in a cafe together, making polite talk while Doug snuck glances at the bewitchingly talkative dark-haired girl sitting across the table. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t get rid of him after that,&#x201d; Adele says now. &#x201c;Then he says he wants to marry me. I said, &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t have a job!&#x2019; He said &#x2018;Well, if you marry me, I&#x2019;ll get a job.&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d; She shakes her head and laughs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, God. What I got into after that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Married on February 22, 1947, Douglas and Adele Springsteen rented a small apartment in the Jerseyville neighborhood on the eastern edge of Freehold and experienced the postwar boom along with much of America. True to his word, Doug had landed a job on the factory floor of the Ford auto plant in nearby Edison. Adele already had a full-time job as a secretary for a real estate lawyer. A baby was on the way by the start of 1949, and the boy emerged at 10:50 p.m. on the evening of September 23, taking his first breath in Long Branch Hospital (since renamed Monmouth Medical Center), where his father&#x2019;s sister had breathed her last twenty-two years earlier. He had brown hair and brown eyes, weighed in at 6.6 pounds, and was declared healthy in every respect. His twenty-four-year-old parents named him Bruce Frederick Springsteen and though they had their own home, instructed the nurse to write into the birth certificate that their home address in Freehold was 87 Randolph Street.<br> <br>When his wife and child were discharged from the hospital a week later, Doug took them to his parents&#x2019; house and handed little Bruce to his mother. She held him close, cooing gently at the first new life that had entered their home since the long ago death of Virginia. When Alice peered into his eyes, her own tired face came alight. Almost as if she were seeing the glimmer that had once glowed from inside her own lost daughter. She clutched the boy to herself and for the longest time would not let him go.<br> <br>She must have loved you to pieces, Bruce heard someone say not long ago. He laughed darkly. &#x201c;To pieces,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;would be correct.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>Spending his first months in his parents&#x2019; small apartment, Bruce ate, slept, stirred, and cried like every other baby. And yet the blood in his veins carried traces of forebears whose lives describe American history going all the way back to the early seventeenth century, when Casper Springsteen and wife Geertje left Holland to build their future in the New World. Casper didn&#x2019;t survive very long,1 but a son who had remained in Holland followed in 1652, and Joosten Springsteen launched generations of Springsteens, including a branch that drifted to the farmlands of Monmouth County, New Jersey, at some point in the mid-eighteenth century. After the Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, John Springsteen left his farm to serve as a private in the Monmouth County militia, fighting multiple battles during a three-year hitch that ended in 1779. Alexander Springsteen, also of Monmouth County, joined the Union army in 1862, serving as a private with the New Jersey Infantry until the end of the Civil War in 1865. Throughout, and into the twentieth century, the Springsteens worked as farm laborers and, with the growth of industrialization in Freehold, factory workers.<br> <br>Alice Springsteen&#x2019;s family were Irish immigrants from Kildare who came to America in 1850, settling in the farmlands of Monmouth County, where they worked the fields and, in some cases, pushed their families up another rung or two on the economic ladder. Christopher Garrity, the patriarch of the family, sent for his wife and children in 1853. His daughter Ann met a neighbor, a laborer named John Fitzgibbon, soon after and married him in 1856. Two years later he invested the $127.50 it took to buy a family home at 87 Mulberry Street2, a street in a growing neighborhood of working-class homes just south of Freehold&#x2019;s center. Ann Garrity marked their place by planting a beech tree seedling she had brought to America from Kildare. The tree flourished, as did Ann and John Fitzgibbon, who had two children in the years before John went to serve in the Civil War. As a sergeant in the Union army, John earned a chest full of ribbons for his courage on the battlefields of Fredericksburg and Charlottesville, Virginia, then returned home to father another seven children before dying in 1872. Remarried to a shoemaker named Patrick Farrell, Ann delivered a set of twins, including a girl named Jennie, whose own daughter, Alice, eventually married a young electronics worker named Fred Springsteen.<br> <br>If only every member of the family could have grown as straight and strong as Ann Garrity&#x2019;s beech tree. But as fate and genetics must have it, both sides of Fred and Alice Springsteen&#x2019;s lineage came with a shadow history of fractured souls. The drinkers and the failures, the wild-eyed, the ones who crumbled inside of themselves until they vanished altogether. These were the relatives who lived in rooms you didn&#x2019;t enter. Their stories were the ones that mustn&#x2019;t be told. They inspired the silence that both secreted and concentrated the poison in the family blood. Doug could already sense the venom creeping within himself. Which may have had something to do with why he had fallen so deeply for Adele Zerilli, whose indomitable spirit would protect and nurture him for the rest of his life.<br> <br>The youngest of the three daughters born to Anthony and Adelina, Italian immigrants who had arrived as teenagers (separately) at Ellis Island during the first years of the twentieth century, Adele spent her childhood in the Bay Ridge neighborhood at the southern tip of Brooklyn. The family&#x2019;s luxe home came courtesy of Anthony, who had learned English on the fly and quickly earned his American citizenship and a law school degree. Taking a job in a law firm his uncle had founded to specialize in real estate, investments, and the like, Anthony&#x2019;s bluster grew along with the firm&#x2019;s success in the 1920s. Short but broad chested, possessed of a big voice, stylish wardrobe, and charisma to match, the thriving attorney moved through the world like a weather front, altering the barometric pressure of any room he entered. Adelina, on the other hand, pursued the life of an old-fashioned Italian lady, wearing traditional dresses, surrounding herself with reminders of the Old World, and refusing to utter more than a small handful of English words even as her daughters grew to be modern American girls.<br> <br>When the Depression hit in 1929, Anthony wished he could go back in time, too. Reduced to moving his family into an apartment, he borrowed some of his remaining clients&#x2019; cash to keep his own investments afloat. Then he borrowed more. Then he borrowed too much. Meanwhile, Anthony had other indulgences, too, including an affair with a secretary who eventually claimed his heart. Anthony&#x2019;s marriage ended first, and then the federal agents came knocking. &#x201c;I guess the word is embezzlement,&#x201d; Adele says.<br> <br>Then the word was convicted, then sentenced. And as Anthony prepared to spend a few years away, he bought an inexpensive old farmhouse on sixty acres near the edge of Freehold and had it fixed up so his family could live as comfortably, if inexpensively, as possible while he did his bit in the grim caverns of Sing Sing prison. Only by then, Adelina&#x2019;s broken marriage and abrupt financial descent had unstrung the observant Catholic so thoroughly that she decided to let her daughters make their own household while she took refuge with relatives. Told to provide for her younger sisters, the recent high school grad Dora took a job as a waitress and kept her sisters on a short leash. Weekly visits from an aunt who always came bearing a suitcase full of spaghetti and tinned tuna helped make ends meet. The girls could also count on the help of the man their father had introduced as George Washington, an African-American day laborer he hired to serve as his daughters&#x2019; chauffeur and handyman. And though his name wasn&#x2019;t really George Washington (that was apparently Anthony&#x2019;s invention), and he was a grown man in his thirties, he became a regular presence in the home. &#x201c;All we knew about him was that he could dance,&#x201d; Adele says. According to middle sister Eda, the action heated up at seven o&#x2019;clock when the nightly Your Hit Parade came on the radio. That&#x2019;s when they turned up the volume, pulled aside the living room rug, and kicked up their heels. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s when we learned how to dance,&#x201d; she continues. &#x201c;It sounds crazy, I know, but that&#x2019;s how it went.&#x201d; The vision makes Adele&#x2019;s son laugh out loud. &#x201c;They used to go to the balls, and the soldiers were on leave, and they went to dance, dance, dance,&#x201d; Bruce says. &#x201c;They had it all going on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dora and Eda had sided with their mother in the divorce, while Adele was officially neutral but sympathetic enough to heed her father&#x2019;s request to accompany his girlfriend on the journey to Ossining, New York, so she would have the right to participate in Sing Sing&#x2019;s family visiting hours. When Dora got wind of her sister&#x2019;s jailhouse visits, she filed papers with the Monmouth County courts to bring it to a stop. And when Anthony convinced Adele to join his beloved secretary on another trip anyway, Dora had her sister put on probation. &#x201c;It was stupid, because I was a baby!&#x201d; Adele says. So she must have been terribly aggrieved...</p><h2>23 Questions About Hell: DVD included...with Bill&#39;s amazing story and the lessons he learned from his visit to hell.</h2><p><p><i>23 Questions About Hell</i> contains to-the-point answers to the questions that Bill Wiese has most been asked about hell since his best-selling <i>23 Minutes in Hell </i>first released.

She writes of his childhood as an immigrant from Russia, his student days at Yale, his early career as a struggling artist, and his crucial role in the development of the New York School of Abstract Expressionism. The progression of his work is analysed in detail, from his early figurative experiments of the 1920s to the emergence of his characteristic mature abstract style, with a particularly illuminating discussion of the achievement of the late canvases. His relationship with such contemporaries as Adolph Gottlieb and Clyfford Still is also examined in some depth.

One minute it&#x2019;s small-town monochrome neighborhoods and then boom&#x2014;all of a sudden you&#x2019;re in a sprawling Technicolor freak show, dense with midgets.<br>Unfortunately, this story does not take place in Los Angeles.<br>The place I was sitting was a small city in the Midwest which will remain undisclosed for reasons that will become obvious later. I was at a restaurant called &#x201c;They China Food!&#x201d; which was owned by a couple of brothers from the Czech Republic who, as far as I could tell, didn&#x2019;t know a whole lot about China or food. I had picked the place thinking it was still the Mexican bar and grill it had been the previous month; in fact, the change was so recent that one wall was still covered by an incompetent mural of a dusky woman riding a bull and proudly flying the flag of Mexico, carrying a cartoon burrito the size of a pig under her arm.<br>This is a small city, large enough to have four McDonald&#x2019;s but not so big that you see more than the occasional homeless person on the way. You can get a taxi here but they&#x2019;re not out roving around where you can jump off the sidewalk and hail one. You have to call them on the phone, and they&#x2019;re not yellow.<br>The weather varies explosively from day to day in this part of America, the jet stream undulating over us like an angry snake god. I&#x2019;ve seen a day when the temperature hit one hundred and eight degrees, another when it dipped eigh teen degrees below zero, another day when the temperature swung forty-three degrees in eight hours. We&#x2019;re also in Tornado Alley, so every spring swirling, howling charcoal demons materialize out of the air and shred mobile homes as if they were dropped in huge blenders.<br>But all that aside, it&#x2019;s not a bad town. Not really.<br>A lot of unemployment, though. We&#x2019;ve got two closed factories and a rotting shopping mall that went bankrupt before it ever opened. We&#x2019;re not far from Kentucky, which marks the unofficial border to the South, so one sees more than enough pickup trucks decorated with stickers of Confederate flags and slogans proclaiming their brand of truck is superior to all others. Lots of country music stations, lots of jokes that contain the word &#x201c;nigger.&#x201d; A sewer system that occasionally backs up into the streets for some unknown reason. Lots and lots of stray dogs around, many with grotesque deformities.<br>Okay, it&#x2019;s a shithole.<br>There are a lot of things about this undisclosed city that the chamber of commerce won&#x2019;t tell you, like the fact that we have more than quadruple the rate of mental illness per capita than any other city in the state, or that in the &#x2019;80s the EPA did a very discreet study of the town&#x2019;s water supply in hope of finding a cause. The chief inspector on that case was found dead inside one of the water towers a week later, which was considered strange since the largest opening into the tank was a valve just ten inches wide. It was also considered strange that both of his eyes were fused shut, but that&#x2019;s another story.<br>My name is David, by the way. Um, hi. I once saw a man&#x2019;s kidney grow tentacles, tear itself out of a ragged hole in his back and go slapping across my kitchen floor.<br>I sighed and stared blankly out of the window of They China Food!, occasionally glancing at the clock sign that flashed 6:32 P.M. in the darkness from the credit union across the street. The reporter was late. I thought about leaving.<br>I didn&#x2019;t want to tell this story, the story of me and John and what&#x2019;s happening in Undisclosed (and everywhere else, I guess). I can&#x2019;t tell the story without sounding as nuts as a ... a nut bush, or&#x2014;whatever nuts grow from. I pictured myself pouring my heart out to this guy, ranting about the shadows, and the worms, and Korrok, and Fred Durst, babbling away under this wall-sized portrait of a badly drawn burrito. How was this going to turn into anything but a ridiculous clusterfuck?<br>Enough, I said to myself. Just go. When you&#x2019;re on your deathbed you&#x2019;re gonna wish you could get back all the time you spent waiting for other people.<br>I started to stand but stopped myself halfway up. My stomach flinched, as if cattle-prodded. I felt another dizzy spell coming on.<br>I fell hard back into the booth. More side effects. I was already light-headed, my body trembling from shoes to shoulders in random spells, like I swallowed a vibrator. It&#x2019;s always like this when I&#x2019;m on the sauce. I dosed six hours ago.<br>I took slow, deep breaths, trying to cycle down, to level off, to chill out. I turned to watch a little Asian waitress deliver a plate of chicken fried rice to a bearded guy on the other side of the room.<br>I squinted. In half a second I counted 5,829 grains of rice on her plate. The rice was grown in Arkansas. The guy who ran the harvester was nicknamed &#x201c;Cooter.&#x201d;<br>I&#x2019;m not a genius, as my dad and all my old teachers at Undisclosed Eastern High School will inform you with even the slightest provocation. I&#x2019;m not psychic, either. Just side effects, that&#x2019;s all.<br>The shakes again. A quick, fluttery wave, like the adrenaline rush you get when you lean your chair too far past the tipping point. Might as well wait it out, I guess. I was still waiting on my &#x201c;Flaming Shrimp Reunion,&#x201d; a dish I ordered just to see what it looked like. I wasn&#x2019;t hungry.<br>A flatware set was wrapped in a napkin on the table in front of me. A few inches away was my glass of iced tea; a few inches from that was another object, one I didn&#x2019;t feel like thinking about right then. I unwrapped my utensils. I closed my eyes and touched the fork, immediately knew it was manufactured in Pennsylvania six years ago, on a Thursday, and that a guy had once used it to scrape a piece of dog shit from his shoe.<br>You&#x2019;ve just gotta make it through a couple of days of this, said my own voice again from inside my skull. You&#x2019;ll open your eyes tomorrow or the next day and everything will be okay again. Well, mostly okay. You&#x2019;ll still be ugly and kind of stupid and you&#x2019;ll occasionally see things that make you&#x2014;<br>I did open my eyes, and jerked in shock. A man was sitting across from me in the booth. I hadn&#x2019;t heard or felt or smelled him when he slid into the seat. Was this the reporter I spoke to on the phone?<br>Or a ninja?<br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I mumbled. &#x201c;Are you Arnie?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah. Did you doze off there?&#x201d; He shook my hand.<br>&#x201c;Uh, no. I was just tryin&#x2019; to rub somethin&#x2019; off the back of my eyelid. I&#x2019;m David Wong. Good to meet ya.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late.&#x201d;<br>Arnie Blondestone looked just like I imagined him. He was older, uneven haircut and a bad mustache, a wide face made for a cigar. He wore a gray suit that looked older than I was, a tie with a fat Windsor knot.<br>He had told me he was a reporter for a national magazine and wanted to do a feature on me and my friend John. It wasn&#x2019;t the first request like this, but it was the first one I had agreed to. I looked the guy up on the Web, found out he did quirky little human-interest bits, Charles Kuralt stuff. One article about a guy who obsessively collects old lightbulbs and paints landscapes on them, another about a lady with six hundred cats, that sort of thing. It&#x2019;s what polite people have instead of freak shows I guess, stories we can laugh at around the coffee machines in the office break room.<br>Arnie&#x2019;s gaze stayed on my face a little too long, taking in my beads of cold sweat, my pale skin, the thatch of overgrown hair. Instead of pointing out any of that, Arnie said, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look Asian, Mr. Wong.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not. I was born in [Undisclosed]. I had the name changed. Thought it would make me harder to find.&#x201d;<br>Arnie gave me the first of what I assumed would be many, many skeptical looks. &#x201c;How so?&#x201d;<br>I half closed my eyes, my mind flooding with images of the 103 billion humans who have been born since the species appeared. A sea of people living, dying and multiplying like cells in a single organism. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to clear my mind by focusing on a mental image of the waitress&#x2019;s boobs.<br>I said, &#x201c;Wong is the most common surname in the world. You try to Google it, you&#x2019;ve got a shitload of results to sift through before you get to me.&#x201d;<br>He said, &#x201c;Okay. Your family live around here?&#x201d;<br>Getting right to it, then.<br>&#x201c;I was adopted. Never knew my real dad. You could be my dad, for all I know. Are you my dad?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Eh, I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br>I tried to figure out if these were warm-up questions to prime the interview pump, or if he already knew. I suspected the latter.<br>Might as well go all-in. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re here, right?<br>&#x201c;My adopted family moved away, I won&#x2019;t tell you where they are. But get out your pen because you&#x2019;ll want to write this down. My biological mom? She was institutionalized.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That must have been hard. What was the&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She was a strung-out, crank-addicted cannibal, dabbled in vampirism and shamanism. My mom, she worshipped some major devil when I was a toddler. Blew her welfare check every month on black candles. Sure, Satan would do her favors now and then, but there&#x2019;s always a catch with the Devil. Always a catch.&#x201d;<br>A pause from Arnie, then, &#x201c;Is that true?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. This, this silliness, it&#x2019;s what I do when I&#x2019;m nervous. She was bipolar, that&#x2019;s all. Couldn&#x2019;t keep a house. Isn&#x2019;t the other story better, though? You should use it.&#x201d;<br>Arnie gave me a practiced look of reporterly sincerity and said, &#x201c;I thought you wanted to get the truth out, your side of it. If not, then why are we even here, Mr. Wong?&amp;rdq...</p></p><h2>Everest, Book 3: The Summit</h2><p>Disaster strikes in this spellbinding conclusion to Gordon Korman's thrilling Everest trilogy.<br><br>Four kids are prepared to go into thin air in order to become the youngest person ever to climb Everest.

There, accompanied by their friend Miss Charlotte Heywood, they encounter an array of eccentric villagers and visitors. Among Sanditon's most prominent residents: Lady Denham, a childless, twice-widowed dowager with a fortune to bequeath and a flight of distant relations circling for a place in her will.</p><p>The Darcys have scarcely settled into their lodgings when Lady Denham unexpectedly invites them to a dinner party. Thirteen guests assemble at Sanditon House-but their hostess never appears. As a violent storm rises, a search for Lady Denham begins. The Darcys, like most of their fellow attendees, speculate that one of her ladyship's would-be heirs has grown impatient ... until the guests start to vanish one by one.</p><p>Does a kidnapper lurk in the centuries-old mansion, or is a still more sinister force at work? As the night grows short, the dwelling's population grows thin, and tales of Sanditon House's storied past emerge, Mr. and Mrs. Darcy find themselves leading a desperate effort to discover what has happened to Lady Denham and the missing guests, before they all-perhaps even Elizabeth and Darcy themselves-disappear.</p><p>The Regency era's answer to Nick and Nora Charles, the Darcys once again demonstrate their quick wits and signature wit as they search for the truth-universally acknowledged and otherwise.</p></p><p>Award-winning author CARRIE BEBRIS holds a master's degree in English literature and is a member of the Jane Austen Society of North America.

Acorn, created in 1970 to specialize in the stocks of small, rapidly growing companies, has one of the best long-term performance records in the mutual fund industry. A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with a master's degree from the same university, Wanger lives in Chicago with his wife, Leah, a Harvard Ph.D. and partner in Wanger Asset Management, and their two daughters. He has three children from a previous marriage.Wanger has managed the highly successful Acorn mutual fund for over 25 years, investing in undervalued but financially sound smaller companies with superior growth potential. Because there are so many stocks to evaluate, Wanger first looks for growth themes and then identifies specific companies. He doesn't believe in market timing and considers mutual funds to be the best option for most investors. Like Peter Lynch and John Rothchild's One Up on Wall Street (S. &amp; S., 1989), this book does a good job of explaining the basics of investing in a nontechnical and often amusing manner, though it is largely limited to Wanger's own investing experience.

Then came the announcement that the whole thing was a hoax. End of story. Case closed. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except that two agents of the most secret intelligence agency in the U.S. government were on the scene and disappeared without reporting in. And four more agents who were sent in also disappeared. So the head of the agency and his two top agents went in and managed to get out with their discovery: an invasion is underway by slug-like aliens who can touch a human and completely control his or her mind. What the humans know, they know. What the slugs want, no matter what, the human will do. And most of Iowa is already under their control. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sam Cavanaugh was one of the agents who discovered the truth. Unfortunately, that was just before he was taken over by one of the aliens and began working for the invaders, with no will of his own. And he has just learned that a high official in the Treasury Department is now under control of the aliens. Since the Treasury Department includes the Secret Service, which safeguards the President of the United States, control of the entire nation is near at hand . . . </p><p></p></p><p>Like many people, I go way, way back with Heinlein.

Rod has decided to take his entire family on &#x201c;the Grand Tour&#x201d; for his fifty-first birthday: a whirlwind of restaurants, galleries, and concert halls from Paris to Florence to Vienna to Amsterdam. But Frederick Troy only gets as far as Vienna. It is there that he crosses paths with an old acquaintance, a man who always seems to be followed by trouble: British spy turned Soviet agent Guy Burgess. Suffice it to say that Troy is more than surprised when Burgess, who has escaped from the bosom of Moscow for a quick visit to Vienna, tells him something extraordinary: &#x201c;I want to come home.&#x201d; Troy knows this news will cause a ruckus in London&#x2015;but even Troy doesn&#x2019;t expect an MI5 man to be gunned down as a result, and Troy himself suspected of doing the deed. As he fights to prove his innocence, Troy is haunted by more than just Burgess&#x2019;s past liaisons&#x2015;there is a scandal that goes up to the highest ranks of Westminster, affecting spooks and politicians alike.

But I suppose policeman aren&#x2019;t really clubbable, are they?&#x201d;<br>Troy hit him in the sternum. More of a tap than blow. Just enough to send Burgess backwards into the sofa.<br>&#x201c;How quickly you catch on.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bloody hell,&#x201d; said Burgess. &#x201c;I mean, bloody hell.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Stop pretending, Guy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Stop pretending what?&#x2019;<br>Troy picked up the briefcase.

The map McClellan was following, reproduced in <em>Great Maps of the Civil War</em>, shows lines in pencil along the true course of the Warwick, apparently drawn after it was too late. </p><p>Most people interested in the Civil War are fascinated by maps - for what they tell about the battles, for what they tell about the terrain, and in some cases for their artistic beauty. But maps reproduced in books have limitations and there is not a good way of preserving a map collection - until now. Fifteen chapters in <em>Great Maps of the Civil War</em> each contain two or three maps that can be pulled out of a pocket. Ten of the maps are 18" x 24"; others are smaller. In addition to a discussion of the battles and the roles of the maps, the book tells about Civil War mapmakers and the methods they used.</p><p>Stunningly designed, this unique full-color book will make a significant addition to the library of any Civil War enthusiast or those who are fascinated by maps and mapmakers.<br></p></p><p><strong>William J. Miller</strong> is the author of <em>Mapping for Stonewall: The Civil War Service of Jed Hotchkiss</em>, winner of the Fletcher Pratt Award for best nonfiction Civil War book of the year, and considered the best study of the most famous mapmaker of the Civil War.

He has written twelve other titles in the popular Crinkleroot series, most recently <i>Crinkleroot's Visit to Crinkle Cove.</i> The Crinkleroot character can now be seen on PBS in the new animated series about the natural world, <i>Backyard Safari.</i> Mr. Arnosky won the Eva L. Gordon Award for his outstanding children's science literature and the 1988 <i>Washington Post/</i>Children's Book Guild Award for his overall contribution to nonfiction for children. He resides in South Ryegate, Vermont.Grade 1-3-Crinkleroot, the little forest-dwelling man who was "born in a tree and raised by bees" is back. Here, he takes readers on a tour of his home and shows how the forest and its inhabitants change with the seasons. Spring wildflowers, otters swimming in the river in summer, autumn leaves, and animal tracks in the winter snow are all depicted. The book combines chatty prose sprinkled with facts and watercolor illustrations-some of which are realistic (like the wildflowers) and others, like Crinkleroot himself, that are more cartoonlike. This combination of styles lends a certain charm, but this work is less successful than others in the series because of its lack of focus. Although it's loosely structured around the theme of seasons, the author often digresses. For example, the discussion of spring wildflowers segues into a section on growing popcorn. The text also incorporates project ideas and puzzles and quizzes. The latter are problematic in that they may be too difficult for the children who will enjoy the simple text. Fans of the series will be the most likely audience for this book, although parts may seem familiar as they've been taken from other "Crinkleroot" titles (S &amp; S).<br><i>Arwen Marshall, New York Public Library </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Black Templars (Codex)</h2><p>This codex is for Warhammer 40,000 4th edition.</p><p></p><h2>A Night Too Dark: A Kate Shugak Novel (Kate Shugak Novels)</h2><p><p></p><p>A Night Too Dark is New York Times bestselling writer Dana Stabenow&#x2019;s latest, the seventeenth in a series chronicling life, death, love, tragedy, mischief, controversy, nature, and survival in Alaska, America&#x2019;s last real frontier.<br><br>In Alaska, people disappear every day.

If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

The Communist Pathet Lao has taken over this former French colony. Most of the educated class has fled, but Dr. Siri Paiboun, a Paris-trained doctor whose late wife had been an ardent Communist, remains. And so this 72-year-old physician is appointed state coroner, despite the fact that he has no training or even supplies to use in performing his new task. What he does have is curiosity and integrity. At his age he is not about to let a bunch of ignorant bureaucrats dictate to him.</p> <p>One of his first cases involves three bodies recovered from a reservoir, but Dr. Siri establishes that the cause of death was not drowning. These men seem to have been electrocuted, perhaps tortured, and they also seem to be Vietnamese, which could have international repercussions. And then there is the inexplicable death of a Party bigwig&#x2019;s equally important wife. She collapsed and died at a banquet. But Dr. Siri doesn&#x2019;t think her death was from natural causes.</p> <p>In the course of his investigations, Dr. Siri must travel to his birthplace, a Hmong village he has not visited for more than 60 years, where he makes a profound discovery, not only about the motive for several murders, but about himself.</p> <p><strong>Colin Cotterill</strong> was born in London, taught in Australia, the U.S., Laos and Japan, and lives in Chiang Mai, in northern Thailand on the Burmese border.

Do you live in financial chaos?Do you underestimate your worth? Are you ready to go to the next level, but can't seem to get there? If the answer is yes to these questions, you may be an underearner.</p><p>Underearners are self-saboteurs who never live up to their earnings potential, says Barbara Stanny, a financial educator, motivational speaker, former journalist, and career counselor. Underearners tend to live paycheck to paycheck. They rarely balance their checkbooks and are often in debt. Ironically, many work incredibly hard. Yet they are ashamed to admit that money matters to them. They all have a high tolerance for low pay.</p><p>The good news is that underearning is often self-imposed. By focusing on overcoming underearning, you will not only earn what you deserve, but you can live up to your full potential. With techniques and exercises that have helped thousands of people who have participated in her Overcoming Underearning&#x2122; workshops, Stanny teaches you five essential steps to financial independence. Once you understand these steps, you will be confident asking for a raise, increasing your prices, or getting a better job. "Now I'm making more than my friends, all because I had the guts to dream and ask for more," says one Stanny fan.</p><p><em>First, Tell the Truth</em>: be honest about your financial situation and figure out your attitudes toward money. Second, <em>Make a Decision</em>: decide that you want to make more money. Third, <em>Stretch</em>: take action, face your fears, and be willing to be uncomfortable. Fourth, <em>Create Community</em> by finding supporters and asking for help. Fifth, <em>Respect and Appreciate Money</em>: learn to save and invest.</p><p><em>Overcoming Underearning</em> is filled with inspiring, real-life stories of underearners who turned their lives around. Stanny brings a message of empowerment and hope to all those who chronically undervalue themselves. "I'm making more, working less, feeling healthier, have more energy, and I'm so much happier," concludes another Stanny believer.</p></p><p><p>Barbara Stanny, the leading authority on women and money, is a popular motivational speaker, financial educator, former journalist, and career counselor. She is the author of <strong>Prince Charming Isn't Coming: How Women Get Smart About Money</strong> and <strong>Secrets of Six-Figure Women</strong>. She lives in Washington state.</p>Stanny let the men in her life-first, her father, Richard Block of H&amp;R Block, and then her husband-manage her money, but a divorce and a financial crisis served as a wake-up call. Since then, the author of Secrets of Six-Figure Women and Prince Charming Isn't Coming has taken her message on the road to show underearners how to achieve a greener financial future, and here lays out her five-step plan for those with money worries who want to earn, as the subtitle suggests, what they deserve. Step one, Stanny says, is "You've got to be willing to be uncomfortable." She defines many of the barriers and negative mindsets that plague underearners and uses exercises throughout the book to help readers with their "Inner Work," or their attitudes about money and self worth. It may take some very intensely willful delusion for readers who barely scrape by to envision themselves slathered in dough (and cynics may balk at the inspirational quotes from, say, Oprah and Groucho Marx), which is why Stanny employs a mind-spirit-pocketbook approach-learn to embrace money, be strong about what you want, earn more because you're worth more-that aims to change readers' thinking about money and improve financial habits (bottom line: save more). The advice here is common sense, but Stanny's upbeat empowerment will hit home with readers feeling the paycheck blues.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

During the First World War, he served in the Army Medical Corps, and there revealed himself as a pioneering psychiatrist, being one of the first to recognise shell shock as a psychological illness rather than moral weakness. He returned to England after the war, worked in Harley Street and published many papers on psychological medicine. In 1921, he heard a lecture by the Russian philosopher P.D. Ouspensky which was to prove a turning point in his life. He became a pupil of the &#39;Fourth Way&#39; teaching of the Armenian G.I.Gurdjieff and from 1931, ran his own study groups in England on the psychological and spiritual teaching that became known as &#39;The Work&#39;. And all along, he combined his understanding of the Fourth Way with his understanding of Christian teaching in the New Testament scriptures. &#39;The Mark&#39; and &#39;The New Man&#39; are the books of his which most clearly explore this interest.</p><h2>Medicine Women: A Pictoral History of Women Healers</h2><p>Women have always been healers -- from the priestess healers in the temples of Isis, to the hedge-witches and herbalists of medieval times, to the physicians, researchers, and alternative practitioners of today. This glorious book celebrates the history of women healers from earliest times to the present. It includes profiles of women healers from all traditions. Some are well known, such as Hildegard of Bingen, Florence Nightingale, and Mary Baker Eddy. Others deserve to be more widely recognized, such as Trotula of Salerno, who wrote gynecological and obstetrical texts in thirteenth-century Italy, and Mama Lola, a respected mambo or healing priestess in the Haitian Voodoo tradition. Text and pictures detail the many contributions of women to the healing arts, from the founding of nursing orders and the tending of soldiers, to the establishment of public health hospitals, to contemporary applications of the ancient lore of herbal medicine and therapeutic touch.</p><p></p><h2>National Geographic Kids Almanac 2018 (National Geographic Almanacs)</h2><p>Kids can have fun keeping up with our quickly changing world with the New York Times best-selling Almanac, packed with incredible photos, tons of fun facts, crafts, activities, and fascinating features about animals, science, nature, technology, and more.

Kennedy, Jr., as a young boy, peering out from under his father&#x2019;s desk in the Oval Office. But few realize that the desk itself plays a part in one of the world&#x2019;s most extraordinary mysteries a dramatic tale that has never before been told in its full scope. Acclaimed historian Martin Sandler a two-time Pulitzer Prize nominee, winner of seven Emmy� Awards, and author of more than 50 books finally brings the entire story to light. This amazing high-seas adventure encompasses the search for the Northwest Passage in the early 1800s; a renowned explorer and his crew of 128 men who vanish during an 1845 expedition; 39 incredible, heroic attempted rescue missions; a ghost ship that drifts for more than 1,200 miles; a queen&#x2019;s gratitude; and that famous desk. Fascinating rare photographs, paintings, engravings, and maps illustrate the book throughout.<br>It all began when, in one of the biggest news stories of the 19th century, Sir John Franklin and his ships the <i>Erebus </i>and the <i>Terror</i> disappeared while attempting to locate the fabled Northwest Passage. At the request of Franklin&#x2019;s wife, Lady Jane, the first mission set out from England in hopes of finding him; many others followed in its wake, none successful.<br>Among these was the <i>Resolute</i>, the finest vessel in Queen Victoria&#x2019;s Navy. But in 1854 it became locked in Arctic ice and was abandoned by its captain. A year later, a Connecticut whaler discovered it 1,200 miles away drifting and deserted, a 600-ton ghost ship. He and his small crew boarded the<i> Resolute</i>, and steered it through a ferocious hurricane back to New London, Connecticut. The United States government then reoutfitted the ship and returned it to the thankful Queen. In 1879, when the <i>Resolute </i>was finally retired, she had the best timbers made into a desk for then-President Rutherford B. Hayes. It is still used by U.S. presidents today...one of the most celebrated pieces of furniture in the White House.</p><p>When Captain John Buddington of New London, Conn., set out on a whaling expedition in September 1855, he discovered the HMS Resolute, a British navy ship without a soul on board. How the Resolute made it from its British home port to Arctic Sea whaling territory to a central place in the White House's Oval Office makes up the core of this gripping historical adventure. Describing the explorers who set out to conquer the Arctic "Otherworld" as the "astronauts of their day," Pulitzer nominee Sandler creates a taut, absorbing story and a multi-faceted portrait of heroism that encompasses the overwhelming missteps, hardships and almost irrational tenacity that sprung from British naval secretary John Barrow's decision that Britain would discover the fabled Northwest Passage around the new world-a task he believed would take no longer than "a single season." That decision would be followed by 40 years of failed search-and-rescue missions-of which the Resolute was just one-after the initial 1845 voyage, led by Captain John Franklin, disappeared. The discovery of the Resolute represented both a vital clue in Franklin's disappearance and a haunting symbol of its nation's inexhaustible determination to make navigating the passage a uniquely British triumph. Sandler eloquently illustrates how the expedition became a new quest for the Holy Grail and provides an adventure story worthy of that tradition. 20 photos, 30 b/w illustrations.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Though there are plenty of detailed works about specific Arctic expeditions, a general history suffices for some readers. Sandler surveys the famous quest for the Northwest Passage, which the British navy actively pursued from 1818 to the early 1850s, when Robert McClure and crew made the first complete passage. But his renown was then and has ever since been eclipsed by the man he and several other commanders were dispatched to find: Sir John Franklin, whose disastrous fate is relayed in <i>Ice Blink,</i> by Scott Cookman (2000). Among the many stories Sandler tells, the strangest concerns a ship, the <i>Resolute</i>, which was abandoned by another of Franklin's would-be rescuers. Somehow, the <i>Resolute</i> drifted back to civilization, was discovered by an American whaling ship, and was returned to an appreciative Britain obsessed with any trace of Franklin. Later, Queen Victoria had a desk hewn from the <i>Resolute</i> and given to President Rutherford Hayes; it today occupies the Oval Office. Endowed with dozens of images, Sandler's enticement to a popular topic in exploration history is well suited to library requirements. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A heartless savage, the Ronin, or "wandering samurai," slashes his way up from the gutter to wealth, honor and status. In spite of his crime sand bloodthirsty cruelty, he bears the strange mark of destiny that the wise see and respect, even as he destroys them.<br><br>Told with humor and irony, the tale ranges from the pleasantly colloquial to the brutally satiric, yet never relents in the Ronin's ruthless search for the truth. The storyteller hides nothing and speaks bluntly, yet this jewel-like tale shimmers with tantalizing riddles that will haunt the reader just as they haunted the Ronin. Sure to shock, confound and ultimately inspire readers,<i>The Ronin</i> is loosely based upon an ancient legend told to the author by the Zen Master Nyogen Senzaki.</p><p><b>William Dale Jennings</b> was a novelist and gay-rights pioneer. His novel, <i>The Cowboys,</i> was adapted for film and starred John Wayne and Colleen Dewhurst."A thunderbolt, full of lightning and excitement, one you won't put down until its last extraordinary page." &#x2014;<b><i>The Japan Times</i></b></p><h2>Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah (Volume 1)</h2><p>Impelled by wanderlust and the spirit of adventure and aided by an extraordinary facility in Eastern languages, Sir Richard Burton (1821-90) was one of the great traveler-explorers of history. He was the first European to enter the capital of Somaliland and the first to discover the Great Lakes of Central Africa. He was also an Orientalist of the first rank.<br>But it is for his pilgrimage in 1853 to Mecca and Medina and the most sacrosanct shrines of Islam that Burton is best known &#x2014; and for his celebrated book that recorded his experiences during the journey. Successfully posing as a wandering dervish, he gained admittance to the holy Kaabah and to the Tomb of the Prophet at Medina and participated in all the rituals of the Hadj (pilgrimage). He is still one of the very few non-Moslems to visit and return from Mecca.<br>Above all, Burton was a sharp observer &#x2014; of character, customs, and physical surroundings. These pages contain a treasury of material on Arab life, beliefs, manners and morals; detailed descriptions of religious ceremonies, mosques, temples, etc.; and a variety of ethnographic, economic, and geographical information. Whether telling of the crowded caravan to Mecca, engaging in minute analysis of Bedouin character, waxing lyrical about a desert landscape, or reporting conversations with townsfolk or fellow pilgrims, Burton gives us a vivid picture of the region and its people.<br>Along with his thorough familiarity with the cultures and languages of the Middle East, Burton exhibited a resourcefulness and presence of mind that were to serve him well along the way. These qualities saw him through many a taut situation in a country where violence was easily kindled. And they permitted him to get to and into places a man with less enterprise would never have dreamed of going.<br>This book&#x2019;s value to historians of culture and religion, Orientalists, and other scholars is obvious. Yet it is as a great classic of travel that it has attracted such a wide audience. Burton&#x2019;s highly personal style, vigorous opinions, and his matter-of-fact humor against a backdrop of constant hazard and possible exposure have delighted tens of thousands of readers for more than a century. This reprint gives today&#x2019;s readers an opportunity to enjoy this unique work.</p><p></p><h2>The Scavenger&#39;s Guide to Haute Cuisine</h2><p><em>A nature writer's obsession with a 100-year-old cookbook leads him on a fascinating journey into the American wilderness.</em><p>A hybrid of memoir, cookbook, and travelogue, and a love song to hunting and fishing and the American wild, <em>The Scavenger's Guide to Haute Cuisine</em> is about one man's quest to live off the land and recreate the recipes from Escoffier's <em>Le Guide Culinaire</em>, the 1903 magnum opus that still stands as one of the greatest haute cuisine cookbooks ever written.</p><p>Nature writer Steven Rinella takes along his vegetarian girlfriend and a cast of eccentric friends and embarks on a year-long journey across America, trying to locate the bizarre, often esoteric ingredients of <em>Le Guide Culinaire</em>, such as animal organs and the surprisingly elusive street pigeon. His adventures take him fishing for stingrays on a Florida beach; skinning eels with an upstate New Yorker who keeps an emu as company; hunting mountain goats on the snow-covered cliffs of Alaska's Chugach Range; and flying from Montana to Michigan to collect a fifteen pound snapping turtle his mother found on the highway. Originating in an article Rinella wrote for <em>Outside</em> magazine, <em>The Scavenger's Guide</em> is written in prose that's as clear and pleasing as a mountain stream and is ultimately an ode to mother nature. The result is a narrative that opens up a deeper understanding of the things we eat and how the natural world affects the way we live.</p></p><p>Steven Rinella is a Michigan native and correspondent for <i>Outside</i> magazine. His essays and reporting have appeared in <i>The New Yorker, Nerve, DoubleTake, The Best American Travel Writing</i> (2004), and <i>Field and Stream</i>. He lives in Miles City, Montana. This is his first book.No, this is not a book about dumpster diving. Instead, it's the account of how Rinella, an <i>Outside</i> correspondent, set off on a quixotic year-long adventure in the wild with the end goal of preparing a three-day, 45-course banquet chosen from master chef Escoffier's classic 1903 <i>Le Guide Culinaire</i>, now considered (by most people) an exotic historical document rather than a working cookbook. Rinella intended to shoot, fish, slaughter, raise (as in pigeon husbandry), gather and otherwise procure the ingredients for these dishes himself, with help from his fishing and hunting buddies (also with the aid of freezers, which Escoffier would no doubt have envied). Rinella's girlfriend is a vegetarian, and he's aware that this project may seem distressing to some, but he offers a spirited defense of choosing to "make his own food." Rinella's year took him all over the U.S. and Canada with plenty of unusual outdoor adventures: frog gigging, eeling, "glassing" for elk, making headcheese and sparrow-trapping. Preparing the feast, with its huge list of ingredients, took more than a week, with hard-breathing last-minute tension. Some dishes worked, some didn't (e.g., Crayfish Mousse, and Elk and Antelope Kidney Pudding). This unusual memoir could serve as a tasty gift for sporting types. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Block's descriptions of this enclave of artists, writers, and rock musicians is thoroughly convincing--although in actuality, the Paddington is a combination of the real-life Chelsea Hotel and Block's outrageous imagination.<p> This is Bernie Rhodenbarr's ninth heist. Bernie is a gentleman burglar who runs a used bookstore in between criminal acts, steals mostly from the rich, and only hurts people when it becomes <i>absolutely</i> necessary.</p><p> The Paddington is where Bernie goes to liberate the letters of a reclusive writer named Gulliver Fairborn from a literary agent. Fairborn's resemblance to J.D. Salinger and, of course, the fact that the woman who hired Bernie to steal the letters had an affair with Fairborn when she was a teenager, no doubt lend the book its title. But by the time Bernie gets to the Paddington, the agent has been shot, the letters already liberated--and a cop in the lobby recognizes our favorite burglar from a previous encounter. </p><p> Now all Bernie has to do is find out who else wanted those letters badly enough to kill for them. In typical Rhodenbarr tradition, the plot is less interesting than the trappings: the books Bernie reads, the fascinating objects he picks up along the way. The reader also learns about some mind-expanding facts, such as the existence of a tiny South American fish that swims up a man's urine stream and lodges in his private parts! Or did Block make that up, too?</p><p> Other Bernie picks include: <i>The Burglar in the Closet</i>, <i>The Burglar in the Library</i>, <i>The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling</i>, and <i>The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza</i>. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Bernie Rhodenbarr, bookseller by day, burglar by night, is on the prowl again. Pretty Alice Cottrell has hired him to infiltrate the crumbling old Paddington Hotel and steal back the letters of reclusive author Gulliver Fairborn from his once-upon-a-time agent, who now wishes to sell them at auction. Seems like an easy enough job, until Bernie discovers the letters missing -- and the agent dead in her bed. With the police only footsteps behind him, Bernie's got to make a fast escape or take the rap for a murder he didn't commit.<p>Only then does Bernie begin to wonder if he's been set up by a criminal -- one who is almost as clever as he is.</p></p><h2>Wild Trek</h2><p>This is the story of the trapper, Link Stevens, and his fearless snow dog, Chiri.

Forced to live by Stone Age methods, they relied on every resource of the dog&#39;s wild cunning and the trapper&#39;s woodlore. How they battled a killer cougar and bloodthirsty wolves, yet brought their man to safety, is a gripping, action-packed saga.

Michelle Bernard has a rare gift for putting in plain words extraordinarily effective and levelheaded ways to properly care for cats. Steering clear of faddish, dangerous trends-and dissecting the oodles of misinformation that has regrettably become the norm in mainstream advice on animal nutrition-she shines most conspicuously on the issue of a proper feline diet. By giving the reader a common-sense, straightforward strategy for preparing a diet that is based solely on the nutritional requirements of true carnivores, her book is a must-have for anyone committed to building and maintaining glowing good health for cats. Bernard&#39;s work on all aspects of caring naturally for cats is based on years of meticulous research and hands-on experience, yet she translates her knowledge into simple, common sense guidelines that anyone can understand and put to use. Her eloquent explanation of homeopathy demystifies this splendid, ancient healing art that is so marvelously suited to cats, giving the reader a valuable awareness about how to build and nurture a cat&#39;s health from the inside out. This alone is a refreshing and most welcome approach given the routine over-medication and over-vaccination of cats. If you love your cat, read this book. All of it.</p><p>"The time has come to look again at the basic ideas of the nature of living things if we hope to redeem the health of our pets.

But history tells a different story as filmmaker Oliver Stone and historian Peter Kuznick reveal in this riveting account of the rise and decline of the American empire.<br><br>Aided by the latest archival findings and recently declassified documents and building on the research of the world&#x2019;s best scholars, Stone and Kuznick construct an often shocking but meticulously documented &#x201c;People&#x2019;s History of the American Empire&#x201d; that offers startling context to the Bush-Cheney policies that put us at war in two Muslim countries and show us why the Obama administration has had such a difficult time cleaving a new path.<br><br>Stone and Kuznick will introduce readers to a pantheon of heroes and villains as they show not only how far the United States has drifted from its democratic traditions, but the powerful forces that have struggled to get us back on track.<br><br>The authors reveal that:<br>� The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were militarily unnecessary and morally indefensible.<br>� The United States, not the Soviet Union, bore the lion&#x2019;s share of responsibility for perpetuating the Cold War.<br>� The U.S. love affair with right-wing dictators has gone as far as overthrowing elected leaders, arming and training murderous military officers, and forcing millions of people into poverty.<br>� U.S.-funded Islamist fundamentalists, who fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, have blown back to threaten the interests of the U.S. and its allies.<br>� U.S. presidents, especially in wartime, have frequently trampled on the constitution and international law.<br>� The United States has brandished nuclear threats repeatedly and come terrifyingly close to nuclear war.<br> <br>American leaders often believe they are unbound by history, yet Stone and Kuznick argue that we must face our troubling history honestly and forthrightly in order to set a new course for the twenty-first century. Their conclusions will challenge even experts, but there is one question only readers can answer: Is it too late for America to change?</p><p>Oliver Stone&nbsp;made such iconic films as&nbsp;<i>Platoon</i>,<i>&nbsp;Wall&nbsp;Street</i>,<i>&nbsp;JFK</i>,<i>&nbsp;Born on the Fourth of July</i>,<i>&nbsp;Natural Born Killers</i>,<i>&nbsp;Nixon</i>,<i>&nbsp;Salvador</i>, and&nbsp;<i>W</i>.<br><br>Peter Kuznick is professor of history and director of the award-winning Nuclear Studies Institute at&nbsp;American University and is currently serving his fourth term as distinguished lecturer with the Organization of&nbsp;American Historians.

Though Wilson won the electoral college vote handily, the popular vote was closer: he received 42 percent to 27 percent for Roosevelt, the Progressive Party candidate, and 23 percent for Taft. Debs, running for a fourth time, tallied 6 percent of the vote.<br> <br>Wilson would put his personal stamp on the office and the country to a much greater extent than his immediate predecessor or his successors. Descended from Presbyterian ministers on both sides of the family, Wilson could be strongly moralistic and infuriatingly and self-righteously inflexible. His rigidity was often fueled by the dangerous belief that he was carrying out God&#x2019;s plan. He shared his predecessors&#x2019; sense of the United States&#x2019; global mission. In 1907, the Princeton president declared, &#x201c;The doors of the nations which are closed must be battered down.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Concessions obtained by financiers must be safeguarded by ministers of state, even if the sovereignty of unwilling nations be outraged in the process.&#x201d;1 In keeping with that sentiment, he would repeatedly transgress against the sovereignty of unwilling nations. And he shared his southern forebears&#x2019; sense of white racial superiority, taking steps to resegregate the federal government during his tenure in office. Wilson even screened D. W. Griffith&#x2019;s pioneering though notoriously racist film Birth of a Nation at the White House in 1915 for cabinet members and their families. In the film, a heroic Ku Klux Klan gallops in just in time to save white southerners, especially helpless women, from the clutches of brutish, lascivious freedmen and their corrupt white allies&#x2014;a perverse view of history that was then being promulgated in less extreme terms by William Dunning and his students at Columbia University. Upon viewing the film, Wilson commented, &#x201c;It is like writing history with Lightning and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true.&#x201d;2<br> <br>As Richard Hofstadter noted over seventy years ago, Wilson&#x2019;s &#x201c;political roots were Southern, his intellectual traditions were English.&#x201d; Among the English thinkers, he was most taken with the conservative views of Walter Bagehot. Bagehot&#x2019;s influence was apparent in Wilson&#x2019;s 1889 study The State, in which Wilson wrote, &#x201c;In politics nothing radically novel may safely be attempted. No result of value can ever be reached&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. except through slow and gradual development, the careful adaptations and nice modifications of growth.&#x201d; What he liked about the American Revolution was that, in his view, it wasn&#x2019;t revolutionary at all. The French Revolution, on the other hand, was an abomination. He deplored Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s embrace of revolution in general and the French Revolution in particular. He disapproved of labor and agrarian radicalism and expressed greater sympathy for business than for labor. Overall, Wilson had a deep abhorrence of radical change in any form.3<br> <br>Wilson&#x2019;s hatred of revolution and staunch defense of U.S. trade and investment would color his presidency and influence his policies both at home and abroad. &#x201c;There is nothing in which I am more interested than the fullest development of the trade of this country and its righteous conquest of foreign markets,&#x201d; he told the Foreign Trade Convention in 1914.4<br> <br>Together these views shaped Wilson&#x2019;s policy toward Mexico, where American bankers and businessmen, particularly oilmen, had a major stake in the outcome of the revolution. Between 1900 and 1910, U.S. investments in Mexico doubled to nearly $2 billion, giving Americans ownership of approximately 43 percent of Mexican property values, 10 percent more than Mexicans themselves owned.5 William Randolph Hearst alone held over 17 million acres.<br> <br>U.S. and British corporations had thrived under Porfirio D�az&#x2019;s three-decade dictatorship, laying siege to almost all of Mexico&#x2019;s minerals, railroads, and oil.6 They had reason for concern when Francisco Madero&#x2019;s revolutionary forces overthrew D�az in 1911. Many U.S. businessmen quickly soured on the new regime and applauded when Victoriano Huerta, with the support of U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Henry Lane Wilson, ousted Madero in the waning days of the Taft administration.7 But Woodrow Wilson, upon coming to power, not only refused to recognize the new government, whose legitimacy he questioned, he sent tens of thousands of troops to the Mexican border and warships to the oil fields near Tampico and the port of Vera Cruz.<br> <br>Wilson, who had once voiced a desire to teach Latin Americans &#x201c;to elect good men,&#x201d;8 itched for an excuse to intervene directly, overthrow Huerta, and tutor the backward Mexicans in good government. He got what he wanted on April 14, 1914, when U.S. sailors who rowed to Tampico were arrested for being in a war zone without a permit. When the Mexican commanding officer released them a couple hours later, he apologized both to them and to their U.S. commanding officer, Admiral Henry Mayo, who refused to accept the apology in the face of such an insult. Mayo demanded that the Mexican forces give a twenty-one-gun salute to the American flag. Instead, General Huerta added his apology and promised to punish the responsible Mexican officer. Over the objections of Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan and Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, Wilson backed Mayo. He rejected Huerta&#x2019;s offer of a reciprocal salute by the two sides and asked Congress to authorize the U.S. military to exact &#x201c;the fullest recognition of the rights and dignity of the United States.&#x201d;9 Congress eagerly complied. Wilson sent a force of seven battleships, four fully manned marine troop transports, and numerous destroyers to Mexico. When Mexicans at Vera Cruz resisted U.S. seizure of a customhouse, over 150 were killed. Six thousand marines occupied Vera Cruz for seven months.<br> <br>In August 1914, U.S.-backed Venustiano Carranza replaced Huerta. But Carranza, a staunch nationalist, refused to bargain with Wilson, who then threw his support behind Pancho Villa, beginning a bungled series of political and military interventions into the Mexican Revolution.<br> <br>While the United States was busy policing its neighbors to the south, far more ominous developments were occurring in Europe. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by a Serbian fanatic on June 28, 1914, triggered a chain of events that, in August, plunged the world into the most brutal orgy of bloodshed and destruction humanity had yet seen. That predominantly European bloodletting&#x2014;the Great War, World War I&#x2014;would be only the start of a century of unending warfare and horrific violence, human and technological barbarism on an unimaginable scale, that would later come to be known as the American Century.<br> <br>The twentieth century dawned with a rush of optimism. War seemed a distant relic of a cruel and primitive past. Many people shared the optimistic belief propounded by Norman Angell in his 1910 book The Great Illusion that civilization had advanced beyond the point where war was possible. Such optimism proved illusory indeed.<br> <br>Europe was awash in imperial rivalries. Great Britain, with its powerful navy, had reigned supreme in the nineteenth century. But its economic model of cannibalizing the economies of increasing parts of the globe and not investing in its own homegrown manufacturing was failing. Reflecting Great Britain&#x2019;s ossified social order and lack of investment at home was the fact that, in 1914, only 1 percent of young Brits graduated from high schools compared with 9 percent of their U.S. counterparts.10 As a result, Great Britain was being eclipsed by the United States in terms of industrial production, and, more ominously, its continental rival Germany was competing in the production of steel, electrical power, chemical energy, agriculture, iron, coal, and textiles. Germany&#x2019;s banks and railroads were growing, and in the battle for oil, the newest strategic fuel that was necessary to power modern navies, Germany&#x2019;s merchant fleet was rapidly gaining on Great Britain&#x2019;s. Great Britain was now 65 percent dependent on U.S. oil and 20 percent on Russian and was coveting potential new reserves of the Middle East, which were part of the tottering Ottoman Empire.<br> <br>A latecomer to the imperial land grab, Germany felt cheated of its due. It intended to right that wrong. Its economic and political penetration of the Ottoman Empire worried Great Britain. It set its sights on Africa. It wanted more.<br> <br>Other troubling signs appeared. A European arms race was occurring on land and, especially, at sea, where Great Britain and Germany battled for naval dominance. Great Britain&#x2019;s big-gun dreadnought class of battleships gave it the upper hand&#x2014;for now. And European nations conscripted young men into vast standing armies.<br> <br>Entangling alliances threatened to turn local conflicts into global conflagrations. And in August 1914, when Austria-Hungary declared war against Serbia, what looked like a third Balkan war quickly spiraled out of control. The Central Powers&#x2014;Germany, Turkey, and Austria-Hungary&#x2014;lined up against the Triple Entente&#x2014;France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, and Russia. Others would soon join. The battlefields would run red with blood.<br> <br>Only Europe&#x2019;s large socialist and labor parties and trade unions could prevent the slaughter. Many belonged to the socialist Second International. They knew that the most important conflict was between capital and labor, not German workers and their British counterparts. They pledged that if the capitalists went to war, the workers would refuse to follow. Why, they asked, should workers die to enrich their exploiters? Many supported a general strike. The more radical, like Vladimir Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg, vowed, if war started, to overthrow the capitalist regimes. Hopes of stopping the madness rested with Germany, where the Social Democrats were the largest party in parliament, and with France.<br> <br>But those hopes were crushed when German socialists, claiming they had to defend the country against the Russian hordes, voted for war credits and the French, vowing to defend against the autocratic Germans, did the same. Only in Russia and Serbia did the socialists stand true. In country after country, nationalism trumped internationalism, loyalty to nation outweighed loyalty to class. Europe&#x2019;s naive young men marched off to die for God, glory, greed, and defense of the fatherland. Humanity was dealt a blow from which it has never fully recovered.<br> <br>The slaughter was on as civilization plunged into what Henry James described as &#x201c;this abyss of blood and darkness.&#x201d;11 American social reformer Reverend John Haynes Holmes expressed the crushing impact it had on reformers everywhere: &#x201c;suddenly, in the wink of an eye, three hundred years of progress is tossed into the melting-pot. Civilization is all gone, and barbarism come.&#x201d;12<br> <br>Most Americans sympathized with the Allies against the Central Powers, but few clamored to join the fight. Americans of all political persuasions feared getting dragged into Europe&#x2019;s bloodletting. Eugene Debs urged workers to oppose the war, wisely observing &#x201c;Let the capitalists do their own fighting and furnish their own corpses and there will never be another war on the face of the earth.&#x201d;13 As reports of the fighting filtered in, antiwar sentiment held strong. The most popular song of 1915 was &#x201c;I Didn&#x2019;t Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier.&#x201d;<br> <br>Despite overwhelming sympathy for the Allies, the United States declared neutrality in the war. But many Americans, particularly those of German, Irish, and Italian heritage, sided with the Central Powers. &#x201c;We have to be neutral,&#x201d; Wilson explained, &#x201c;since otherwise our mixed populations would wage war on each other.&#x201d;14 It was, however, a neutrality in principle more than in practice. Economic interests clearly placed the United States in the Allied camp. Between 1914, when the war began, and 1917, when the United States entered, U.S. banks loaned $2.5 billion to the Allies but only $27 million to the Central Powers. The House of Morgan was especially involved, serving as the British government&#x2019;s sole purchasing agent between 1915 and 1917. Eighty-four percent of Allied munitions bought in the United States during those years passed through Morgan hands.15 Overall, the $3 billion the United States was selling to Great Britain and France by 1916 dwarfed the miniscule $1 million it sold to Germany and Austria-Hungary. Although deep-seated resentments toward Great Britain, stemming from the Revolutionary period and the War of 1812, had not completely abated, most Americans identified the Allied nations as democracies and Germany as a repressive autocracy. Czarist Russia&#x2019;s involvement on the Allied side made it difficult to draw such clear lines. And both sides regularly violated the United States&#x2019; neutral rights. Great Britain, relying on its superior naval power, launched a blockade of northern European ports. Germany retaliated with a U-boat (the German word for &#x201c;submarine&#x201d; was Unterseeboot) campaign that threatened neutral shipping. Wilson accepted the Allied blockade but protested vigorously against Germany&#x2019;s actions. Bryan foresaw clearly that Wilson&#x2019;s tilt toward the Allies would drag the United States into the war and tried to maintain a more evenhanded approach. He had opposed allowing loans to the combatants, warning Wilson, &#x201c;Money is the worst of all contrabands because it commands everything else.&#x201d;16 Though intent on remaining neutral so that he could help mediate an end to the war, Wilson rejected Bryan&#x2019;s effort to bar U.S. citizens from traveling on belligerents&#x2019; ships.<br> <br>In May 1915, Germany sank the British liner Lusitania, leaving 1,200 dead, including 128 Americans. Roosevelt called for war. Despite initial disclaimers, the ship was in fact carrying a large cargo of arms to Great Britain. Bryan demanded that Wilson condemn the British blockade of Germany as well as the German attack, seeing both as infringements of neutral rights. When Wilson refused, Bryan resigned in protest. Though Wilson had won reelection in 1916 on the slogan &#x201c;He kept us out of war,&#x201d; he was increasingly coming to believe that if the United States didn&#x2019;t join the war, it would be denied a role in shaping the postwar world.17<br> <br>On January 22, 1917, Wilson dramatically delivered the first formal presidential address to the Senate since the days of George Washington. He laid bare his soaring vision for peace and the future. He called for &#x201c;peace without victory&#x201d; based on core American principles: self-determination, freedom of the seas, and an open world with no entangling alliances. The centerpiece of such a world would be a league of nations that could enforce the peace, a demand initially advanced by groups within America&#x2019;s peace movement such as the Woman&#x2019;s Peace Party.<br> <br>When he concluded, the Senate erupted in applause. Senator John Shafroth of Colorado called it &#x201c;the greatest message of a century.&#x201d;18 The Atlanta Constitution wrote, &#x201c;&nbsp;&#x2018;Startling,&#x2019; &#x2018;staggering,&#x2019; &#x2018;astounding,&#x2019; &#x2018;the noblest utterance that has fallen from human lips since the Declaration of Independence,&#x2019; were among the expressions of senators. The president himself after his address said: &#x2018;I have said what everybody has been longing for, but has thought impossible....</p><h2>My Name Is Bill: Bill Wilson--His Life and the Creation of Alcoholics Anonymous</h2><p>In this thoroughly researched and groundbreaking biography of Bill Wilson, cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous, acclaimed author Susan Cheever creates a remarkably human portrait of a man whose life and work both influenced and saved the lives of millions of people.

She was preparing to bake an apple pie, cutting the apples and then rolling out the crust, and keeping an eye on the popcorn just warming up in a cast-iron pan over the woodstove. The big north-facing room where she worked smelled of cooking: of flour and the sweetness of apples, of a batch of sugar cookies and the sausage frying for the stuffing. Usually, she found these smells delicious, but this afternoon they were nauseating. Pregnancy ruined everything, she thought. </p><p> Emily could hear the others thumping around upstairs, Grandma Wilson and Gilly, and the rhythmic thunk, thunk of someone splitting wood in the big shed where the sheep and goats were penned in for the winter. Up the hill a dog barked. Out the back windows the kitchen garden, where a few pumpkins still lazed against the cold earth, was framed by the white columns of the porch, the big pine tree, and the road that followed Mad Tom Brook down to the peaked roof of the railroad station. She could hear the trains going through three times each day -- the Green Mountain Flyer and the midnight sleeper when she was up late. The track came down from Montreal, past Dorset Pond just a few miles north, then right past the general store and the cheese factory, and then down the valley toward Manchester Depot and Manchester Village on the way to Albany, where you could change for Boston or New York City. Grover Cleveland was president, New York City police had just cracked down on an illicit distillery, and Oscar Hammerstein was packing them in at his Olympia Theater. </p><p> Across the green, as night fell and the pains made it harder for her to stay and work at the kitchen table, Emily could just see the parsonage where she and Gilly were planning to live once the baby was born. Then the lights went on in her parents' little white house with the cheerful red door and the green shutters. They would be over for dinner tomorrow, but the thought of them at prayer in the cozy little parlor where she had grown up made the pains subside for a moment. Not that their life had been perfect -- life was always hard -- but right now, alone for a moment, she remembered the innocent girl she had once been. Things had seemed so simple then. Slow-moving oxen pulled the great blocks of marble out of the mountains and loaded them onto railroad cars. There was maple sugaring in the spring and apple picking and cider in the fall. There was the General Store, where Mr. Barrows always smiled at her; the town meetings over in Dorset Village; the Grange Hall, where men argued about politics; the blacksmith shop where the family horses got new shoes; and the cobbler where she went for her own new shoes. </p><p> On the other side of the tracks were the marble mills where the blocks were cut into the slabs that were as common as grass all over town. East Dorset marble was the best marble in the world. There was her family's church and another church for the Irish who had come when the Freedleyville Quarry opened. There was school and playing and wonderful books. Emily had always imagined herself as Becky Thatcher in Mark Twain's book <i>Tom Sawyer</i> -- adventurous, daring, and a little too smart for her own good. Her family, the Griffiths, were local nobility. They were the wealthiest family in town although they would never say so. Her father, Gardner Fayette Griffith, had fought for the Union Army during the Civil War. He had been at Gettysburg with the Vermont 14th Regiment and helped repel Pickett's charge and win the war for the righteous. He owned the town's waterworks. He and his cousin Silas had the idea of selling wood cut from the forests that blanketed the surrounding mountains, and it had been a very good idea. </p><p> For what seemed like a long time the Griffiths had lived happily in their house on the green with their children, their beloved son Clarence and their daughters Millie and Emily. Everyone knew how smart Emily was. After grade school she had gone off to train at the Normal School over in Castleton, and she had become a teacher in the local one-room schoolhouse. Emily had her heart set on more than teaching, though. "Success, success, success, let that be your watchword!" she exhorted her son years later. Now she exhorted herself. Even then, as she carried that first child through the summer and fall of 1895, she imagined being something greater, something a man might be, perhaps a doctor or a lawyer. </p><p> Emily loved her parents -- her father often seemed to be the only person who really understood her. He understood that she was too big for life in their little village. She was aiming for larger things. Her mother was always reminding her that she was a woman and that she should act like a woman, but her father didn't seem to feel that way. She was like him, she told herself. She had high ambitions for everyone around her, ambitions that transcended gender. What her mother called stubbornness she saw as determination; determination like her father's. Even though her father was her best friend, the events of the last few years just seemed to have overwhelmed their friendship. </p><p> First Emily's little brother, Clarence, was sick. There was something wrong with his lungs. He couldn't breathe. Dr. Liddle came over from Dorset and said Clarence had to be sent to Colorado. Of course her parents followed instructions, but it was awful to see the little boy off on the train. Then they got word that the Colorado air hadn't worked. Clarence was dead. Ever since that boy died so far away, and no one knew who was there to comfort him in his last hours, Fayette had been different. Losing his ten-year-old son broke his heart. Even now, she knew her father didn't like complaining. Pregnancy wasn't something she would talk about with him; she had to concentrate on putting her fears aside. </p><p> Fayette Griffith expected that even children would adjust their feelings to life's little practicalities. She remembered the way he had reacted the one time she allowed herself to get sentimental about a farm animal. "Thanksgiving dinner with rousing fires in all the stoves to keep out the zero cold, and plenty of good cheer all around," she remembered forty years later. "The dinners were mostly always turkey. Occasionally we had chicken," she continued, "and once a little young barbecued pig -- and that little pig was my pet -- and the unusual sight of him made me feel kind of sick and faint." She wasn't allowed to leave the table. </p><p> A handsome Yankee woman with long chestnut hair, Emily couldn't believe how quickly she lay her ambitions aside and did what seemed to be expected of her, embracing marriage and motherhood. She was feeling angry at her husband Gilman, who was already not quite shaping up to be the man she had imagined he could be when they married a year before. </p><p> It was almost an arranged marriage. She and Gilly had known each other all their lives. Her family was no-nonsense and well off and lived on the north side of the green; his family was social and gregarious and owned the Wilson House on the south side of the green. Maybe that was the problem. She had grown up in a house; Gilly had grown up running an inn with his widowed mother, drinking with the guests and entertaining them even when he was a boy. Gilly was a charming man, a personable bachelor who had gone to Albany College in New York State. He had already been made manager of the North Quarry, and Emily had hoped that marriage would turn him into a responsible man. </p><p> Their family history seemed to affect Gilly in a different way than it affected her. At twilight on the night of November 25, as preparations for Thanksgiving dinner animated the big kitchen, she began to double over with the contractions -- a kind of pain which dwarfed everything in her previous twenty-five years of life, even the bouts of anxiety that sometimes made her see blackness and feel that nothing was worthwhile. </p><p> The village of East Dorset is still a storybook sort of place. Picturesque but workaday, it's a town that has always been about industry -- even if the product was as lovely as marble or as sweet as maple sugar. Its red and white frame houses huddle around a central green in front of a white clapboard Congregational church with a square, eight-pointed spire, in the narrow valley where Mad Tom Brook meets the Batten Kill. Called the Valley of Vermont, this verdant, limestone path in the land lies between the Green Mountains to the east and the Taconic Mountains to the west. A few miles north of East Dorset, at Dorset Pond in North Dorset, the valley narrows until only a few hundred yards separate the two mountain ranges. Mount Aeolus in the Taconic Range, named for its windy summit by a party of nineteenth-century climbers from Haverford College, slopes above East Dorset on the west side, while Bromley Mountain in the Green Mountain Range rises above the town to the east. </p><p> Sugar maples and oaks, pine and spruce trees, line the two village streets. The woods are still filled with birdsong and wildlife, owls hoot at night, and at the end of summer, flocks of geese honk their way across the sky. The sidewalks are paved with the snowy white marble veined in pale gray that comes from the local quarries. These underground shafts crisscross the surrounding mountains hundreds of feet under the rocky soil but occasionally erupt in a white burst against the green surface of the hills. </p><p> At the corner of Village Street and Mad Tom Road stands the Wilson House, still a rambling old dark red three-story building with white trim. Its rooms have been redone with flowered wallpaper and filled with sturdy oak furniture. Facing the rounded shape of Mount Aeolus, the long porch is the baseline for a jumble of clapboard dormers, shutters, and gables above it. Except for the church, it's the largest building in the small town, and it has been an inn since settlers first moved to this narrow valley back before Vermont was even a state, in the eighteenth century. </p><p> By the end of November the brilliant red and yellow of the New England fall is almost over and the trees throw skeleton shadows in the thin winter light. "No pen can describe the turning of the leaves," wrote Rudyard Kipling, who was living nearby in Brattleboro, Vermont, in his beloved house Naulahka and working on <i>The Jungle Book.</i> "The hillsides as far as the eye could range were afire, and the roads paved with crimson and gold....Then a wet wind blew...till nothing remained but pencil-shading of bare boughs, and one could see into the private heart of the woods." In those days between the brilliance of fall and the great snows of the Vermont winter, the air is sharp and cold. The sun disappears behind the mountain and the dark comes filtering down early. Nights are long. By the end of November, the huge piles of stacked firewood are already beginning to shrink, and the smell of snow and woodsmoke and the occasional baking apple pie swirls around the churchyard, past the old schoolhouse and across the brook toward Mount Aeolus and the world beyond. </p><p> Copyright � 2004 by Susan Cheever</p></p><h2>How To Keep People From Pushing Your Buttons</h2><p>Presents proven strategies for not reacting to antagonists, revealing a third path between &#34;getting mad&#34; and &#34;getting even,&#34; and offers advice on how to stop worrying about what people think, avoiding difficult situations and responsibilities, trying to please everyone, and more.

That war is real; but it sits atop an older struggle, between Kabul and the countryside, between order and chaos, between a modernist impulse to join the world and the pull of an older Afghanistan: a tribal universe of village republics permeated by Islam.</p><br><p>Now, Tamim Ansary draws on his Afghan background, Muslim roots, and Western and Afghan sources to explain history from the inside out, and to illuminate the long, internal struggle that the outside world has never fully understood. It is the story of a nation struggling to take form, a nation undermined by its own demons while, every 40 to 60 years, a great power crashes in and disrupts whatever progress has been made. Told in conversational, storytelling style, and focusing on key events and personalities, <i>Games without Rules</i> provides revelatory insight into a country at the center of political debate.</p><br></p><p><p><b>Tamim Ansary</b> is the author of <i>Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World through Islamic Eyes</i> and <i>West of Kabul, East of New York</i>, among other books.

This insider's perspective fills large gaps in contemporary outsiders' understandings of why these powers have failed and hopefully points the way towards forms of international cooperation that will work for Afghanistan rather than against it. Ansary has a gift for using informal language to illustrate his points in a way that doesn't compromise the legitimacy of his narrative. His ability to contextualize the history and situate it in culture, as well as to remind readers of when to keep track of important figures (sometimes for decades) is refreshing.

Scott Peck. In editing this anthology Peck assembled what he considered to be the most well written, inspirational, and enlightening quotes that speak to the top 12 virtues--happiness, courage, compassion, purity, perseverance, courtesy, faith, goodness, love, respect, strength, and wisdom. He then wrote an introductory essay on each virtue before presenting his lengthy selections of quotes.<p> When introducing the virtue of "Happiness," Peck asserts his controversial belief that, "The lie is that we are here on earth to be comfortable, happy and fulfilled.... The truth is that our finest moments are more likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, propelled by discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers--or even for God."</p><p> He follows this elegant essay with a series of profound, tender, and even playful quotes about happiness, such as "There is nothing more beautiful than cheerfulness in an old man's face." (Jean Paul Richter) "The secret of contentment is the realization that life is a gift, not a right." (Anonymous) As a bonus, <i>Abounding Grace</i> also makes a lasting reference book, one of the best sources of spiritually minded quotes available. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>M.

The author/photographer of Abrams' <i>Extraordinary Chickens</i> and <i>Extraordinary Pheasants</i> as well as the delightful children's book <i>Dudley: The Little Terrier That Could</i>, he lives in New York City.Green-Armytage, who previously highlighted under-appreciated fowl in Extraordinary Chickens and Extraordinary Pheasants, here turns his attention to the much-maligned pigeon. In glossy, full-color photographs, he portrays pigeons and doves both familiar and exotic (mostly the latter): the Silesian Swallow, whose "leg muffs" look like another set of wings sprouting from its shanks; the spindly-legged Maltese; and the plump Marchenero Pouter, who can inflate his crop like a balloon (selective breeding for such a trait began over four centuries ago). For those previously inclined to think of pigeons as city-dwelling "rats with wings," Green-Armytage offers plenty of evidence for a reassessment. Pigeons are monogamous, and the males take part in nest-building, incubating the eggs and feeding the babies; pigeons are excellent messengers (armies have used them for some 2,500 years, from Cyrus of Persia in 550 B.C. to U.S. servicemen in WWII); and they respond well to training and are capable of impressive acrobatics. But the real reason to pick up the book is not Green-Armytage's brief narrative, but the 200 color illustrations of wild and "man-made" (i.e., bred) pigeons and doves-which should do even more to spark admiration for these birds than their feats of derring-do. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Marine diesel engines: Maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair</h2><p><p>If you own a small marine diesel engine that you depend on--at least occasionally--this book was written for you.

By the time Bing Crosby introduced the tune in the winter of 1942, it had evolved into something far grander: the stately yuletide ballad that would become the world's all-time top-selling and most widely recorded song. <p> In this vividly written narrative, Jody Rosen provides both the fascinating story behind the making of America's favorite Christmas carol and a cultural history of the nation that embraced it. Berlin, the Russian-Jewish immigrant who became his adopted country's greatest pop troubadour, had written his magnum opus -- what one commentator has called a "holiday <i>Moby-Dick"</i> -- a timeless song that resonates with some of the deepest themes in American culture: yearning for a mythic New England past, belief in the magic of the "merry and bright" Christmas season, longing for the havens of home and hearth. Today, the song endures not just as an icon of the national Christmas celebration but as the artistic and commercial peak of the golden age of popular song, a symbol of the values and strivings of the World War II generation, and of the saga of Jewish-American assimilation. With insight and wit, Rosen probes the song's musical roots, uncovering its surprising connections to the tradition of blackface minstrelsy and exploring its unique place in popular culture through six decades of recordings by everyone from Bing Crosby to Elvis Presley to *NSYNC. <i>White Christmas</i> chronicles the song's legacy from jaunty ragtime-era Tin Pan Alley to the elegant world of midcentury Broadway and Hollywood, from the hardscrabble streets where Irving Berlin was reared to the battlefields of World War II where American GIs made "White Christmas" their wartime anthem, and from the Victorian American past that the song evokes to the twenty-first-century present where Berlin's masterpiece lives on as a kind of secular hymn.</p></p><p><b>Jody Rosen</b> was born in New York City in 1969. His articles on popular music and the arts have appeared in <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Salon.com.</i> He lives in Manhattan.<b>Introduction: The Hit of Hits</b><p> </p><p> </p><blockquote>God gave Moses the Ten Commandments and then He gave Irving Berlin..."White Christmas." <p> -- <b>PHILIP ROTH,</b></p><p> <i>Operation Shylock</i></p></blockquote> <p> </p><blockquote>They say a hanging man hears gorgeous music.

All the same, I hope that the tune I am about to hear is not Bing Crosby's "White Christmas"...Goodbye, cruel world! <p> -- <b>KURT VONNEGUT,</b></p><p> <i>Mother Night</i></p></blockquote> <p> Irving Berlin was born in the nineteenth century and nearly outlived the twentieth. During the last several of his 101 years, Berlin faced a peculiar indignity: watching the copyrights expire on his earliest published songs. His ownership of those songs had been as tightfisted as the law would permit; he frostily refused permission to reprint his lyrics even to friends working on fawning tributes. Now the songs were leaving him: in 1982, "Marie from Sunny Italy," his first published number, written when Irving Berlin was still Izzy Baline, a nineteen-year-old singing waiter in a Chinatown saloon; in 1984, "My Wife's Gone to the Country (Hurrah! Hurrah!)," his first hit; in 1986, "Alexander's Ragtime Band," his career-making smash, whose clarion opening line -- "Come on and hear" -- announced not just the arrival of a national troubadour but a young country's liberation from Victorianism and swaggering emergence into the century it would claim as its own. </p><p> The old man may have grieved the loss of his songs to the public domain, but much of his catalog had made that journey years before, migrating from Tin Pan Alley straight into national lore. He was born in Siberia, yet seemed to have a direct channel to the American imagination, yanking song after song out of the collective unconscious and returning them to his adopted country as beguiling reflections of its hopes, myths, and passing fancies. He strove to write, he said, "in the simplest way...as simple as writing a telegram." In so doing, he filled the American Songbook with pop standards that sound as inevitable as folk songs; his songs are definitively twentieth-century things -- "a Berlin ballad" appears in Cole Porter's "You're the Top" alongside a Waldorf salad and Mickey Mouse -- yet they strike us as timeless, anonymous. We recognize George Gershwin's musical signature in the bluesy grandeur of "Summertime" and "The Man I Love"; the droll, debonair voice of "Too Darn Hot" and "Miss Otis Regrets" is unmistakably Porter's own. But in Berlin's most celebrated songs -- "Alexander's Ragtime Band," "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody," "Always," "Blue Skies," "Puttin' On the Ritz," "How Deep Is the Ocean?" "Easter Parade," "Cheek to Cheek," "Let's Face the Music and Dance," "God Bless America," "There's No Business Like Show Business" -- Berlin is invisible. It was not an insult when Alec Wilder, in his landmark study of American popular song, declared himself at a loss to describe stylistic common denominators in the songwriter's vast output. </p><p> Berlin's most famous song, by far the most valuable copyright in his (or anyone else's) catalog, is "White Christmas." But as I discovered in writing this book, it may be the Berlin hit least associated with him. Everyone I spoke to about "White Christmas" knew the song; everyone had Bing Crosby's dulcet, definitive recording lodged in his mind's ear. Yet few knew who composed it. This wasn't true just of my contemporaries, who like me had grown up with hip-hop and rock 'n' roll and whose only exposure to Irving Berlin may have been Taco's synth-pop travesty of "Puttin' On the Ritz." I met avowed Berlin fans who not only were unaware that the man had written the tune, but could hardly comprehend that it had been <i>written</i> at all. They assumed "White Christmas" was as old as the hills, its creator as ancient and unknown as the composer of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen." </p><p> But "White Christmas" is a pop song: you could call it <i>the</i> pop song. Berlin liked to brag that the number "was a publishing business in itself," a rare instance of the songwriter -- no slouch at trumpeting his successes -- selling himself short. "White Christmas" is the biggest pop tune of all time, the top-selling and most frequently recorded song: the hit of hits. It is a quintessentially American song that the world has embraced; among the untold hundreds of "White Christmas" recordings are versions in Dutch, Hungarian, Japanese, Swahili, and, in a knowing nod to its creator's pedigree, Yiddish. Sales of "White Christmas" records have topped 125 million copies. </p><p> Bing Crosby's original version on Decca Records remains a music industry landmark. For over fifty years it stood as the best-selling record in history. Introduced in the 1942 film Holiday Inn (it won the Academy Award for Best Song), Crosby's "White Christmas" held first place on the Hit Parade countdown for a record ten consecutive weeks; it would reenter the survey every December for the next twenty years (excepting 1953), spending thirty-eight weeks in the top spot and an unprecedented eighty-six weeks on the chart. All told, Crosby's "White Christmas" has sold over 31 million copies; it was unseated from its place in the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> as the all-time top single only by Elton John's Princess Diana tribute, "Candle in the Wind '97." (Crosby's record reentered the British charts for two weeks the next year -- forty-five years after its initial release.) </p><p> Popular culture is infatuated with novelty, and pop music is particularly unsentimental, ruthlessly turning today's superstar into tomorrow's one-hit wonder, forever seeking refreshment in new styles, new sounds, the next big thing. Once a year, though, the Christmas season brings songs from several centuries back to jostle for airtime with the latest hits. "White Christmas" is a newcomer to the Christmas canon -- the composer of "Joy to the World!" beat Berlin to the punch by at least two hundred years -- but in the decades since its appearance, it has become the most performed of all seasonal songs: the world's favorite Christmas carol. To this day, it continues to generate tens of thousands of annual record and sheet music sales. The Muzak versions that fill the nation's malls each December should alone be enough to pile-drive "White Christmas" into the consciousness of unnumbered future generations of shoppers. </p><p> Although Crosby's remains the signature version, singers won't leave "White Christmas" alone: every year brings new versions by performers that run the musical gamut, from the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to the German heavy metal band Helloween. The list of "White Christmas" performers includes many of the most famous names in twentieth-century popular music: Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Charlie Parker, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, Aretha Franklin, the Beach Boys, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, the Supremes, the Temptations, the Four Tops, the Jackson Five, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand, Bob Marley and the Wailers, Al Green, U2. Berlin's melody has been reimagined as a stuttering punk anthem; as Wagnerian Sturm und Drang with a chorus of thousands wailing in the background; as a loping country ballad; as a string of quicksilver bop improvisations; as a thudding house track -- a carol for an Ibiza Christmas. Otis Redding wrung new pathos from the old song, recasting it as a Memphis soul ballad; Michael Bolton did a laughable Otis Redding imitation and recorded what may be the most overwrought "White Christmas" of them all (and consider the competition). Is there another song that Kenny G, Peggy Lee, Mantovani, Odetta, Loretta Lynn, the Flaming Lips, the Edwin Hawkins Singers, and the Backstreet Boys have in common? What other tune links Destiny's Child, The Three Tenors, and Alvin and the Chipmunks; Perry Como, Garth Brooks, and Stiff Little Fingers; the Reverend James Cleveland, Doris Day, and Kiss? </p><p> But the song's power transcends its sales figures and commercial ubiquity. With "White Christmas," Berlin created an anthem that spoke eloquently to its historical moment, offering a comforting Christmastime vision to a nation frightened and bewildered by the Second World War. But it also resonated with some of the deepest strains in American culture: yearning for an idealized New England past, belief in the ecumenical magic of the "merry and bright" Christmas season, pining for the sanctuaries of home and hearth. Its dreamy scenery belongs to the same tradition as Currier and Ives's landscapes and Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." The song's images of sleigh rides and falling snow and eager children capture the mythic essence of the American Christmas. "White Christmas" seems to have always existed, lurking, as one Berlin biographer has written, "just beneath the surface of national consciousness." Indeed, in writing "White Christmas," Berlin lit on a universal ideal: the longing for Christmas snowfall, now keenly felt everywhere from New Hampshire to New Guinea, seems to have originated with Berlin's song. It can safely be said that London bookmakers didn't offer odds on the possibility of a white Christmas prior to "White Christmas." </p><p> From the beginning, the song has been a blank slate on which Americans have projected their varied views on race, religion, national identity, and other heady matters. In Philip Roth's Operation Shylock, "White Christmas" is an emblem of "Jewish genius," in Kurt Vonnegut's Mother Night, a wearisome reminder of the Second World War. In the early 1940s, at the height of its popularity, "White Christmas" was a huge hit among both white and black audiences. In the decades since, African-Americans have viewed Berlin's anthem with increasing ambivalence, detecting in Crosby's placid "white-bread" crooning a coded message excluding blacks from the national Christmas celebration. The song became a hit in the winter of 1942, when it was embraced by homesick American GIs as a symbol of the country to which they longed to return and the values they were fighting to de...</p></p><h2>Origins of Modern Japanese Literature (Post-Contemporary Interventions)</h2><p>Since its publication in Japan ten years ago, the <i>Origins of Modern Japanese Literature</i> has become a landmark book, playing a pivotal role in defining discussions of modernity in that country. Against a history of relative inattention on the part of Western translators to modern Asian critical theory, this first English publication is sure to have a profound effect on current cultural criticism in the West. It is both the boldest critique of modern Japanese literary history to appear in the post-war era and a major theoretical intervention, which calls into question the idea of modernity that informs Western consciousness.<br>In a sweeping reinterpretation of nineteenth-and twentieth-century Japanese literature, Karatani Kojin forces a reconsideration of the very assumptions underlying our concepts of modernity. In his analysis, such familiar terms as <i>origin, modern, literature,</i> and <i>the state</i> reveal themselves to be ideological constructs. Karatani weaves many separate strands into an argument that exposes what has been hidden in both Japanese and Western accounts of the development of modern culture. Among these strands are: the "discovery" of landscape in painting and literature and its relation to the inwardness of individual consciousness; the similar "discovery" in Japanese drama of the naked face as another kind of landscape produced by interiority; the challenge to the dominance of Chinese characters in writing; the emergence of confessional literature as an outgrowth of the repression of sexuality and the body; the conversion of the samurai class to Christianity; the mythologizing of tuberculosis, cancer, and illness in general as a producer of meaning; and the "discovery" of "the child" as an independent category of human being.<br>A work that will be important beyond the confines of literary studies, Karatani's analysis challenges basic Western presumptions of theoretical centrality and originality and disturbs the binary opposition of the "West" to its so-called "other." <i>Origins of Modern Japanese Literature </i>should be read by all those with an interest in the development of cultural concepts and in the interrelating factors that have determined modernity.</p><p>"I have hopes that Karatani's book--one of those infrequent moments in which a rare philosophical intelligence rises to the occasion of full national and historical statement--will also have a fundamental impact on literary criticism in the West. . . . For "Origins" has some lessons for us about critical pluralism, in addition to its principal message, which turns on that old and new topic of modernity itself."--Fredric Jameson, from the Preface<p></p><p>Karatani Kojin is Professor of Humanities at Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan.

He shows that the true legacy of European civilisation is not the false idealisms that have almost destroyed it - in the shapes of Nazism, fascism and communism - but the culture of forgiveness and irony which we must now protect from those whom it offends.

Ambrose's greatest hits, drawing heavily from his biography of General Dwight D. Eisenhower and several military histories that recount the events of the Allied push across the European continent in 1944 and 1945 from the frontline trooper's perspective. The narrative is vintage Ambrose, full of engaging yet workmanlike prose that conveys the epic scope of its subject while paying careful attention to the details of the often inglorious lives of the GIs. Eisenhower looms large over this book, but it's the ordinary soldiers and their experiences who give the story real life. Readers who have already dipped into the Ambrose library may find sections of <i>The Victors</i> redundant, but for those who want an adept overview of what Ike and his men accomplished, this is a great place to start. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Stephen E. Ambrose is the author of <i>Undaunted Courage,</i> an account of the Lewis and Clark expedition.

At the root of every single major political conflict is the annoying coddling Americans must endure of these harebrained liberal hypocrisies. In fact, most of the time liberals uses the mantle of tolerance as a guise for their pathetic intolerance. And what we really need is smart intolerance, or as Gutfeld reminds us, what we used to call common sense.<br><i><br>The Joy of Hate</i> tackles this conundrum head on--replacing the idiocy of open-mindness with a shrewd judgmentalism that rejects stupid ideas, notions, and people. With countless examples grabbed from the headlines, Gutfeld provides readers with the enormous tally of what pisses us all off. For example:<br>- The double standard: You can make fun of Christians, but God forbid Muslims. It's okay to call a woman any name imaginable, as long as she's a Republican. And no problem if you're a bigot, as long as you're politically correct about it.&nbsp;<br>- The demonizing of the Tea Party and romanticizing of the Occupy Wall Streeters. <br>- The media who are always offended (see MSNBC lineup)<br>- How critics of Obamacare or illegal immigration are somehow immediately labeled racists. <br>- The endless debate over the Ground Zero Mosque (which Gutfeld planned to open a Muslim gay bar next to). <br>- As well as pretentious music criticism, slow-moving ceiling fans, and snotty restaurant hostesses. <br><br>Funny and sarcastic to the point of being mean (but in a nice way), <i>The Joy of Hate</i> points out the true jerks in this society and tells them all off.</p><p><p><b>Guest Review by Jonah Goldberg on Greg Gutfeld&#x2019;s <i>The Joy of Hate</i></b></p> <p><strong>Jonah Goldberg is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times and contributing editor to National Review. A USA Today contributor and former columnist for the Times of London, he has also written for The New Yorker, Commentary, the Wall Street Journal, and many other publications.</strong></p> <p>The funny thing about Gutfeld is that he&#x2019;s really funny. But this fact obscures the other funny thing about Gutfeld: He&#x2019;s really absurdly smart. This is readily apparent to anyone who picks up <i>The Joy of Hate: How to Triumph over Whiners in the Age of Phony Outrage</i>.</p> <p>Gutfeld&#x2019;s basic argument is that the Forces of Tolerance claim an exclusive monopoly on, well, tolerance. But they use tolerance as a cudgel, a means of enforcing political correctness and shaming heretics into silence. &#x201c;The idea of tolerance&#x2014;a seemingly innocuous concept&#x2014;has now become something else entirely: a way to bludgeon people into shutting up, piping down, and apologizing, when the attacked are often the ones who hold the key to common sense,&#x201d; Gutfeld writes. &#x201c;They speak an unspeakable truth, and they get clobbered by the Truncheon of Tolerance. Tolerance has turned normal people into sheep/parrot hybrids, followers in word and deed&#x2014;bloating and squawking at everyone in a psychological torment not experienced since Dave Matthews picked up a guitar.&#x201d; In other words, behind the liberal double-standard conservatives so often complain about is a single standard: the left holds a monopoly on acceptable speech.</p> <p>To his credit, Gutfeld acknowledges that conservatives are too often prone to adopting the &#x201c;voice of perpetual outrage.&#x201d; Gutfeld considers himself a libertarian, albeit one of an admirably Victorian variety, though I may be the only person who&#x2019;d use that adjective. &#x201c;I have a rule,&#x201d; Gutfeld proclaims. &#x201c;Anything that can be done privately does not need to be performed publicly. It&#x2019;s why I love the gays but I hate their parades.&#x201d; The reason I say this is Victorian, is that in Victorian England, there was all sorts of wild hanky-panky going on, but it was behind closed doors. In public there was one social norm for everyone, in private there were so many freak flags flying it looked like the rotunda outside the U.N.</p> <p>Obviously, Gutfeld doesn&#x2019;t want the one standard to be anything nearly so constraining or oppressive as that of Victorian England. But he does want one standard: Don&#x2019;t whine about how someone or something hurts your feelings and is offensive when what really bothers you is that someone disagrees with your point of view or agenda.</p> <p>Gutfeld doesn&#x2019;t mention Herbert Marcuse, but he talks a lot about &#x201c;repressive tolerance,&#x201d; a term Marcuse coined and popularized. The Frankfurt School Marxist argued that traditional&#x2014;i.e., classically <i>liberal</i>&#x2014;notions of tolerance were in fact oppressive because they helped perpetuate the sorts of societies Marcuse disliked (liberal, capitalist, democratic, free, decent, etc). And so, as Frankfurt School Marxists are known to do, he vomited up a bilious stew of nonsense that basically served as a secular fatwa: Leftwing groups are free to say whatever they want, but &#x201c;rightwing&#x201d; groups (defined as any outfit not loyal to leftwing groups) were to be treated as bigoted and offensive simply because they disagreed with leftwing groups. As Marcuse writes, <i>&#x201c;Liberating tolerance, then, would mean intolerance against movements from the Right and toleration of movements from the Left.&#x201d;</i></p> <p>Gutfeld doesn&#x2019;t bother with Marcuse, because Marcuse is dead and was only considered really smart by the people who wanted an eggheaded excuse to be asinine hypocrites. Gutfeld&#x2019;s fight is much closer to the ground. It&#x2019;s an incredibly timely argument, given the new rage for what the kids today call &#x201c;concern trolling.&#x201d; This is where people pretend to be deeply, deeply troubled or concerned about this or that when they&#x2019;re really not. Have you ever noticed how many extremely liberal columnists and TV pundits devote so much time to worrying about the Republican Party&#x2019;s electoral prospects given America&#x2019;s changing demographics? Or evolving attitudes about abortion? Or homosexuality? Because we all know that if the GOP suddenly became pro-choice and for open borders, Keith Olbermann would suddenly start voting Republican.</p>Greg Gutfeld is the host of <i>Red Eye</i> on the Fox News Channel.

Benoit B. Mandelbrot, one of the century&#39;s most influential mathematicians, is world-famous for making mathematical sense of a fact everybody knows but that geometers from Euclid on down had never assimilated: Clouds are not round, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not smooth. To these classic lines we can now add another example: Markets are not the safe bet your broker may claim. In his first book for a general audience, Mandelbrot, with co-author Richard L. Hudson, shows how the dominant way of thinking about the behavior of markets-a set of mathematical assumptions a century old and still learned by every MBA and financier in the world-simply does not work.As he did for the physical world in his classic , Mandelbrot here uses fractal geometry to propose a new, more accurate way of describing market behavior. The complex gyrations of IBM&#39;s stock price and the dollar-euro exchange rate can now be reduced to straightforward formulae that yield a far better model of how risky they are. With his fractal tools, Mandelbrot has gotten to the bottom of how financ</p><p>&#34;Everyone knows that every so often the markets experience swings of mood, when prices jump in a flurry of trading. But classical market theory says they shouldn&#39;t.... Mandelbrot, the mathematician who discovered fractals, argues that we don&#39;t have to abandon the notion of randomness to create a model of the markets that more accurately reflects their reality.&#34;Benoit Mandelbrot, father of fractal geometry, revolutionised our understanding of the models of modern financial theory. This new edition includes material on the current market crisis, calling for an end to the tunnel vision of our bankers whose over-confidence in their understanding of markets ended in catastrophe.</p><h2>The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Ninth Edition</h2><p><b>The essential guide to recorded jazz, now in its ninth edition</b><br><br>Firmly established as the world?s leading guide to jazz, this celebrated reference book is a mine of fascinating information and insightful?often wittily trenchant?criticism. For this completely revised edition, Richard Cook and Brian Morton have reassessed each artist?s entry and updated the text to incorporate thousands of additional CDs and artists. The result is an endlessly browsable companion for jazz aficionados and novices alike.<br><br></p><p>Richard Cook is the former editor of the <b>Wire</b> and is currently the editor of the leading UK jazz magazine, <b>Jazz Review</b>. He is the coauthor of <b>The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings</b>. <br>Brian Morton is a freelance writer and longtime broadcaster for BBC Radio.The updated, eighth edition of this long-running title features more than 14,000 reviews of CDs and 400 new artist entries. Entries include very brief descriptions of the artists and a list of their recordings, with reviews and ratings by the authors. The lengths of the CD entries vary from very short (label, catalog number, issue date, and performers) to extensive, multiparagraph descriptions of the album's history, reception, and individual songs. The authors are clearly devout jazz historians, and the character of the entries is as much admiring as it is strictly factual. Their detailed descriptions of albums, songs, and even artists' tone colors and interpretations within specific songs are testament to their expertise. They also lament the loss of jazz divisions at many major record companies, leaving independent labels to carry the lion's share of the responsibility for documenting this art form. <p>Changes from the previous edition are worth mentioning. The artist index, missing from the seventh edition, has returned in response to reader demand, but to maintain what the authors consider a reasonable physical size for the volume, they have eliminated entries "which have seemed to stand still in recent years through the lack of any new releases by the artist in question." In some particularly long entries containing extensive lists of albums, they offer an "in brief" section, which allows for the inclusion of less-important yet still worthwhile recordings by presenting shorter descriptions. </p><p>Another important feature is the "Core Collection" selections. Within the listings for some artists, recordings considered essential for a basic jazz library are printed in bold type and described in greater detail. A separate list of these 200 titles would have been useful for those who are looking to build their own collections without having to wade through the entire book to find these seminal works. </p><p>Libraries holding the seventh edition, without the author index, will probably want this one. Anything older will certainly need to be updated. <i>Steven York</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In a heartbeat, every aspect of physical sensation within the forge was transformed. Each breath tasted sulfurous on her tongue, the furnace heat baking the air so fiercely that sweat evaporated the instant it formed on her skin. Phosphorescent lichen had been gathered in wall sconces to provide illumination but the fountain' s radiance made them instantly redundant, dominating the modest chamber as the noonday sun would a cloudless summer sky. The room's many shadows had been utterly banished. Instead, the dark face of the chiseled stone was painted now in wild hues of scarlet and gold that never stayed the same from one moment to the next, but moved and changed with such madcap abandon the stone seemed alive. Impressive as those colorations were, they paled in comparison to the appearance of Elora herself, as the fireglow danced across skin the shade of purest polished silver.<br><br>She'd spent the better part of a week preparing the kiln for her examination, scrubbing it clean both physically and mystically. She'd gone over her notes until the order and structure of the requisite spells was engraved as deeply on her consciousness as the house sigils were in the mantlestone above the family hearth. She knew what to expect when she began the summoning, but wasn't sure what would actually happen. It was one thing watching, no matter how intently, when Torquil or his apprentices worked their special brand of magic. Another altogether to try it by herself.<br><br>She was dressed for work in ironcloth trousers, padded at the knees and tucked into stout-soled moccasin boots that laced to the tops of her calves. A sleeveless cotton undershirt hugged her torso. Over that went a proper shirt of cotton interwoven with wool, against the natural damp and chill of the tunnels, and lastly a tunic of the same battered ironcloth as her trousers, padded at both elbows and shoulders. The tunic hung to her knees, slit up both side seams to the waist to allow her legs total freedom of movement. It was cut big in the body, too, which she found a cause for some annoyance, as it made her appear far heftier than she actually was. She was proud of her physique; she'd worked hard and long burning off the excess pounds that had been a part of her all through childhood and didn't care for any reminders of the way she used to look.<br><br>As she crouched before the firespout, her face split in a grin of irrepressible delight. She was determined to fix every aspect of this conjuration in memory, the better to transcribe it later into her journal. The molten rock, she observed, was of a thicker consistency than water, heavier even than oil. Tiny sparks flashed all along its length as the intense heat ignited any stray and wayward scraps of dust in the air that swirled too close. Elora could feel prickles across the small patches of exposed skin and she had to narrow her eyes against the glare, even through the dark glasses the Rock Nelwyns used whenever they channeled lava.<br><br>Unexpectedly, and with a small pop, something wrestled its way through the fissure and slithered up the interior of the fountain, to burst into full view at its summit. Elora beheld a figure that, in broadest brush strokes, consisted of a central torso, a pair of arms, a head. No legs that she could see. The lower half of the creature was one with the pillar of molten rock. Its head began as a featureless orb but the longer she stared at it, the more features and definition appeared: eyes where human eyes should be, a nose bisecting the face, a proper mouth above a strong chin. Streams of russet flame poured back from a sharp widow's peak to form a thick single plait that reached all the way down the figure's back until it blended with the molten stream.<br><br>Elora thought it was a most attractive creature. She hadn't realized she was looking at a vision of herself.</p><h2>An Economic History of the USSR: 1917-1991, 3rd Edition (Penguin Economics)</h2><p>Traces the economic development of the Soviet Union from war communism through the five-year plans and collectivization to the beginning of the Gorbachev reforms and the final disintegration</p><p></p><h2>Resistance</h2><p>From the National Book Award&#x2013;winning author of <i>Arctic Dreams,</i> a highly charged, stunningly original work of fiction&#x2014;a passionate response to the changes shaping our country today.

I left the apartment Mary and I were renting on rue Lepic and strolled in the sunshine up to rue des Abbesses. The old sidewalks were freshly washed, the air was still cool. My regular way was to get a morning paper, a brioche, and black coffee and then sit in the little park by the M�tro station and read. Sometimes I would walk up Yvonne-le-Tac to the terraced park below Sacr�-Coeur instead, but that morning I had that fistful of mail.<br><br>We took the apartment partly because it was right around the corner from the cemetery in Montmartre. Mary was writing an essay about the cemeteries of France for Harper's, a history of how they had been disrupted and desecrated by revolution, by the expansion of cities, and of course by the Church. The Cimeti�re de Montmartre was palpable, a reassurance to her. Many of its graves had been destroyed in 1789, the bodies treated like so much trash by those who hated royalty and aristocracy, and by the hoodlums who always attach themselves to social change. But Degas is buried there, the composer Berlioz, Nijinsky, and her favorite, Adolphe Sax, the inventor of the saxophone.<br><br>It was not these ghosts, though, nor the untroubled all�es colonnaded by plane trees, that calmed her. It was that the stillness sheltered an aggregation of mute evidence, apparent throughout the city in its small-scale neighborhoods, that our history is finally human. Regimes and ideologies-Tamerlane's Mongol empire, Caligula's Rome, Stalin's Soviet Union-whatever their horrors, whatever afflictions they deliver, pass away. What endures is simple devotion to the question of having been alive. The cemetery comforted her because it was not about death but about transcendent joie de vivre.<br><br>One day she returned to the apartment and read me an inscription she'd copied from a gravestone. Ma gracieuse �pouse . . . A husband had expressed his love and regard for his wife of fifty-one years in a few bare, unself-conscious sentences. Mary sat with the piece of paper in her hand by the open window, watching patrons in the bistro across the street talking and hailing friends passing on the sidewalk, and turned a shoulder so I could not see her crying.<br><br>Her tears, I thought, were over a kind of loss we had talked about in recent weeks, the way the fabric of love scorches, no matter how vigilant we are. The intricate nature of the emotions men and women exchange made the two of us sense our own endangerment when we disagreed; but we had also been speaking of the ephemeral love one can feel toward a complete stranger, for the way they step off a sidewalk or a father hands his daughter her gloves at the door. Bound together in these many ways we are still swept suddenly out of each other's lives, by tides we don't recognize and tides we do. The sensation of loss, the weight of grief, the feeling of being naked to a menace are hard to separate. The fear of an outside force at work makes us reticent in love, and suspicious. We identify enemies.<br><br>The instruments of discord show up daily in our lives, of course, demanding our attention. The unscrupulous peer, the woman on the make, the purblind enforcer, the self-anointed official and his cronies, people with a craving for confrontation. We are foolish to give any of them what they ask for, and we betray ourselves and anyone toward whom we have ever felt tender by not sending such people immediately on their way.<br><br>The first two pieces of mail I opened that morning were letters from museums, one in Rouen, the other in Orl�ans. At the time, I was trying to assemble work by European artists which had been shaped by their experience with le Maquis, the French underground, for a show to open at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and then to travel around the United States. The communications were about insuring the works the museums were lending. I read each one with relief as, sentence by sentence, they eliminated the risks on my part. I should have known-the consideration.<br><br>The rest of the mail was personal-friends and family, some items of business for Mary. The one letter I put off reading sat all the while on the green slats of the bench while I finished perusing the paper. The envelope had the look of something you might be sent by the Internal Revenue Service, carrying news of an irregularity in your filings, a notice of additional tax due, perhaps a penalty. But the letter was from another federal authority, a branch of our government but a few years old though already monolithic. Its special charge was to make the nation safe from attack by a great array of vaguely defined "terrorists," domestic and foreign. This work it pursued with religious fervor and special exemptions from the Department of Justice.<br><br>I read the letter twice, concealed it in the half fold of Le Monde, and walked back to the apartment. Mary was in her robe, making breakfast. I handed her the letter and took her place at the stove.<br><br>She read it in the chair by the window.<br><br>"I will never get used to this hyperbolic crap," she said, folding the letter back up. "Every fascist step they take, you expect people to laugh in their faces, just take their toys away, you know-the guns and the new laws. Do they just not register the suspicion, the resentment in half the streets in the world?"<br><br>She turned abruptly to look out the window, as if responding to someone down there on the sidewalk. Incomprehension, exhaustion, fear passed behind her eyes. She let the letter drop to the floor as if it were an advertising circular.<br><br>"I can't believe we have to take people like this seriously, Owen."<br><br>I put breakfast on the table, refreshed her coffee, and came back with my laptop. I began e-mailing a loose network of people I'd been in regular touch with since the change of administration took place in our country. We communicated through a series of codes and used electronic back doors which delayed exchanges, but by mid-morning I'd confirmed what I had suspected. The letter had gone to everyone.<br><br>It came from Inland Security, the group of people we had come to call the Idiots of Light, for the way they are dazzled by their god. Their ranks include people who celebrate the insults of advertising and the deceptions of public relations campaigns as paths to redemption. The letter also originated with the Division of Economic Equality, those in the Department of Commerce we call the Lottery Enforcers, who argue for the calming and salutary effect of regular habits of purchase. And it bore the gold, eagle-talon insignia of the Delta Confederacy, the contingent of citizen groups that reports to the education staff of the Office of Inland Security.<br><br>The letter's authors informed us of the nation's persisting need for democratic reform. Each of us was told of widespread irritation with our work, and the government's desire to speak with us.<br><br>The authority behind the letter-two crisply printed cream-colored sheets of laid paper with signatures in red ballpoint-made my breath shudder. I sat watching for incoming e-mail. We hadn't anticipated this, not exactly this frontal an approach.<br><br>After university I and my friends had scattered abroad-to Brussels, Caracas, Sapporo, Melbourne, Jakarta, any promising corner. Two or three went deep upriver on the Orinoco or out onto the plateaus of Tibet and Ethiopia. We had come to regard the work of writers and artists in our country as too compliant, as failing to expose or indict the escalating nerve of corporate institutions, the increasing connivance of government with business, or the cowardice of those reporting the news. In the 1970s and '80s, we thought of our artists and writers as people gardening their reputations, while the families of our neighborhoods disintegrated into depression and anger, the schools flew apart, and species winked out. It was the triumph of adolescence, in a nation that wanted no part of its elders' remonstrance or any conversion to their doubt.<br><br>The years passed. We had no plan. We had no hope. We had no religion. We had faith. It was our belief that within the histories of other, older cultures we would find cause not to be incapacitated by the ludicracy of our own. It was our intuition that even in those cultures into which our own had injected its peculiar folklore-that success is financial achievement, that the future is better, that life is an entertainment-we would encounter enduring stories to trade in. We thought we might be able to discern a path in stories and performances rooted in disparaged pasts that would spring our culture out of its adolescence.<br><br>This remains to be seen. We stay in close touch (a modern convenience), scattered though we are. And now others, of course, keep close watch on us, on what we write and say, on whom we see. We are routinely denounced by various puppet guards at home, working diligently for a prison system we don't believe in. As the days have mounted, though, we've tasted more of the metal in that system's bars.<br><br>We feel cold.<br><br>Our goal is simple: we want our country to flourish. Our dilemma is simple: we cannot tell our people a story that sticks. It is not that no one believes what we say, that no one knows, that none of our countrymen cares. It is not that their outspoken objections have been silenced by the rise at home of local cadres of enforcement and shadow operatives. It is not that they do not understand. It is that they cannot act. And the response to tyranny of every sort, if it is to work, must always be this: dismantle it. Take it apart. Scatter its defenders and its proponents, like a flock of starlings fed to a hurricane.<br><br>Our strategy is this: we believe if we can say what many already know in such a way as to incite courage, if the image or the word or the act breaches the indifference by which people survive, day to day, enough will protest that by their physical voices alone they will stir the hurricane.<br><br>We're not optimistic.

Hunter (Sociology and Religious Studies/Univ. of Virginia; American Evangelicalism, 1983) uses historical references to religious battles throughout American history to show how yesterday's ecumenical divisions among Catholics, Protestants, and Jews have become realigned in recent years. Through debates about slavery, the Scopes trial, and the influence of deism on the Constitution, he elaborates on the ``new lines of conflict'' through the eyes of both clergy members and the more ``humanist'' intelligentsia. Hunter is adept at demonstrating how the battles are now between ``orthodox'' and ``progressive'' camps within faiths, and how political mine fields like gay rights, Roe v. Wade, and the ordination of women into the priesthood prompt a nagging concern over the roles of churches and synagogues in American life. The author has a pervasive regard for the role of family--possibly ``the beginning and end of contemporary culture'' since its dissolution may prove fatal to our social order. He also illustrates how the classic dualism between God and Satan has been transformed into an often unscrupulous intrigue between traditionalists and ``secular humanists.'' But Hunter betrays a possible bias regarding homosexuality. Here, the anti-gay ``convictions'' of a Jerry Falwell are treated as more worthy of serious debate than the fulminations against the ``evils'' of race- mixing or ``the Jewish Menace.'' In the end, Hunter seems to favor religious thinking over nontranscendental doctrines. Though giving short shrift to the secular viewpoint, Hunter still provides an informative look at America's ambiguous spiritual character. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Smoothly translated, lavishly illustrated, rich with images of honey, flowers, and bees, this is an elegant but flawed curiosity. Like many fairy tales by noted authors, it is wordy, didactic, and full of little inconsistencies. Spirin's silver- and gilt-bordered paintings are astonishing in their execution and detail. Appropriately lush and honey-toned, they are clearly imitative of the works of the Renaissance masters, but unlike many illustrations in the pseudo-Great Master vein, these have a liveliness, energy, and humor all their own. Unfortunately, they have been carelessly placed in relation to the text, appearing sometimes well before, sometimes well after the action they portray, more often interrupting than illuminating the narrative that they adorn.

She lives in Bodega Bay, California. This is her first book.Chapter 1 <br><br>The Socks <br><br>1978 and 1981<br> In 1978, when John Bell first met Reinhold Bertlmann, at the weekly tea party at the Organisation Europ�enne pour la Recherche Nucl�aire, near Geneva, he could not know that the thin young Austrian, smiling at him through a short black beard, was wearing mismatched socks. And Bertlmann did not notice the characteristically logical extension of Bell&#x2019;s vegetarianism&#x2014;plastic shoes. <br><br>Deep under the ground beneath these two pairs of maverick feet, ever-increasing magnetic fields were accelerating protons (pieces of the tiny center of the atom) around and around a doughnut-shaped track a quarter of a kilometer in diameter. Studying these particles was part of the daily work of CERN, as the organization was called (a tangled history left the acronym no longer correlated with the name). In the early 1950s, at the age of twenty-five, Bell had acted as consultant to the team that designed this subterranean accelerator, christened in scientific pseudo-Greek &#x201c;the Proton Synchrotron.&#x201d; In 1960, the Irish physicist returned to Switzerland to live, with his Scottish wife, Mary, also a physicist and a designer of accelorators. CERN&#x2019;s charmless, colorless campus of box-shaped buildings with protons flying through their foundations became Bell&#x2019;s intellectual home for the rest of his life, in the green pastureland between Geneva and the mountains. At such a huge and impersonal place, Bell believed, newcomers should be welcomed. He had never seen Bertlmann before, and so he walked up to him and said, his brogue still clear despite almost two decades in Geneva: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m John Bell.&#x201d;<br><br> This was a familiar name to Bertlmann&#x2014;familiar, in fact, to almost anyone who studied the high-speed crashes and collisions taking place under Bell&#x2019;s and Bertlmann&#x2019;s feet (in other words, the disciplines known as particle physics and quantum field theory). Bell had spent the last quarter of a century conducting piercing investigations into these flying, decaying, and shattering particles. Like Sherlock Holmes, he focused on details others ignored and was wont to make startlingly clear and unexpected assessments. &#x201c;He did not like to take commonly held views for granted but tended to ask, &#x2018;How do you know?,&#x2019; &#x201d; said his professor, Sir Rudolf Peierls, a great physicist of the previous generation. &#x201c;John always stood out through his ability to penetrate to the bottom of any argument,&#x201d; an early co-?worker remembered, &#x201c;and to find the flaws in it by very simple reasoning.&#x201d; His papers&#x2014;numbering over one hundred by 1978&#x2014;were an inventory of such questions answered, and flaws or treasures discovered as a result.<br><br>Bertlmann already knew this, and that Bell was a theorist with an almost quaint sense of responsibility who shied away from grand speculations and rooted himself in what was directly related to experiments at CERN. Yet it was this same responsibility that would not let him ignore what he called a &#x201c;rottenness&#x201d; or a &#x201c;dirtiness&#x201d; in the foundations of quantum mechanics, the theory with which they all worked. Probing the weak points of these foundations&#x2014;the places in the plumbing where the theory was, as he put it, &#x201c;unprofessional&#x201d;&#x2014;occupied Bell&#x2019;s free time. Had those in the lab known of this hobby, almost none of them would have approved. But on a sabbatical in California in 1964, six thousand miles from his responsibilities at CERN, Bell had made a fascinating discovery down there in the plumbing of the theory.<br><br> Revealed in that extraordinary paper of 1964, Bell&#x2019;s theorem showed that the world of quantum mechanics&#x2014;the base upon which the world we see is built&#x2014;is composed of entities which are either, in the jargon of physics, not <i>locally causal,</i> not <i>fully separable</i>, or even not <i>real unless observed</i>.<br><br> If the entities of the quantum world are not locally causal, then an action like measuring a particle can have instantaneous &#x201c;spooky&#x201d; effects across the universe. As for separability: &#x201c;Without such an assumption of the mutually independent existence (the &#x2018;being-?thus&#x2019;) of spatially distant things...,&#x201d; Einstein insisted, &#x201c;physical thought in the sense familiar to us would not be possible. Nor does one see how physical laws could be formulated and tested without such a clean separation.&#x201d; The most extreme version of nonseparability is the idea that the quantum entities are not independently real: that atoms do not become solid until they are observed, like the proverbial tree that makes no sound when it falls unless a listener is around. Einstein found the implications ludicrous: &#x201c;Do you really believe the moon is not there if nobody looks?&#x201d; <br><br>Up to that point, the idea of science rested on separability, as Einstein had said. It could be summarized as humankind&#x2019;s long intellectual journey away from magic (not locally causal) and from anthropocentricism (not independently real). Perversely, and to the consternation of Bell himself, his theorem brought physics to the point where it seemingly had to choose between these absurdities. <br><br>Whatever the ramifications, it would become obvious by the beginning of this century that Bell&#x2019;s paper had caused a sea change in physics. But in 1978 the paper, published fourteen years before in an obscure journal, was still mostly unknown. <br><br>Bertlmann looked with interest at his new acquaintance, who was smiling affably with eyes almost shut behind big metal-rimmed glasses. Bell had red hair that came down over his ears&#x2014;not flaming red, but what was known in his native country as &#x201c;ginger&#x201d;&#x2014;and a short beard. His shirt was brighter than his hair, and he wore no tie. <br><br>In his painstaking Viennese-inflected English, Bertlmann introduced himself: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Reinhold Bertlmann, a new fellow from Austria.&#x201d; <br><br>Bell&#x2019;s smile broadened. &#x201c;Oh? And what are you working on?&#x201d;<br><br> It turned out that they were both engaged with the same calculations dealing with quarks, the tiniest bits of matter. They found they had come up with the same results, Bell by one method on his desktop calculator, Bertlmann by the computer program he had written. <br><br>So began a happy and fruitful collaboration. And one day, Bell happened to notice Bertlmann&#x2019;s socks.<br>Three years later, in an austere room high up in one of the majestic stone buildings of the University of Vienna, Bertlmann was curled over the screen of one of the physics department&#x2019;s computers, deep in the world of quarks, thinking not in words but in equations. His computer&#x2014;at fifteen feet by six feet by six feet one of the department&#x2019;s smaller ones&#x2014;almost filled the room. Despite the early spring chill, the air-conditioning ran, fighting the heat produced by the sweatings and whirrings of the behemoth. Occasionally Bertlmann fed it a new punch card perforated with a line of code. He had been at his work for hours as the sunlight moved silently around the room.<br><br> He didn&#x2019;t look up at the sound of someone&#x2019;s practiced fingers poking the buttons that unlocked the door, nor when it swung open. Gerhard Ecker, from across the hall, was coming straight at him, a sheaf of papers in hand. He was the university&#x2019;s man in charge of receiving preprints&#x2014;papers that have yet to be published, which authors send to scientists whose work is related to their own. <br><br>Ecker was laughing. &#x201c;Bertlmann!&#x201d; he shouted, even though he was not four feet away. <br><br>Bertlmann looked up, bemused, as Ecker thrust a preprint into his hands: &#x201c;You&#x2019;re famous now!&#x201d; <br><br>The title, as Bertlmann surveyed it, read: <br><br><b>Bertlmann&#x2019;s Socks and the Nature of Reality</b><br><i> J. S. Bell</i><br> CERN, Geneve, Suisse <br><br>The article was slated for publication in a French physics periodical, <i>Journal de Physique</i>, later in 1981. Its title was almost as incomprehensible to Bertlmann as it would be for a casual reader. <br><br>&#x201c;But what&#x2019;s this about? What possibly&#x2014;&#x201d; <br><br>Ecker said, &#x201c;Read it, read it.&#x201d;<br><br> He read.<br>The philosopher in the street, who has not suffered a course in quantum mechanics, is quite unimpressed by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations. He can point to many examples of similar correlations in everyday life. The case of Bertlmann&#x2019;s socks is often cited.<br><i> My socks? What is he talking about? And EPR correlations? It&#x2019;s a big joke, John Bell is playing a big published joke on me. </i><br><br>&#x201c;EPR&#x201d;&#x2014;short for the paper&#x2019;s authors, Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen&#x2014;was, like Bell&#x2019;s 1964 theorem, which it inspired thirty years later, something of an embarrassment for physics. To the question posed by their title, &#x201c;Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?,&#x201d; Einstein and his lesser-known cohorts answered no. They brought to the attention of physicists the existence of a mystery in the quantum theory. Two particles that had once interacted could, no matter how far apart, remain &#x201c;entangled&#x201d;&#x2014;the word Schr�dinger coined in that same year&#x2014;1935&#x2014;to describe this mystery. A rigorous application of the laws of quantum mechanics seemed to force the conclusion that measuring one particle affected the state of the second one: acting on it at a great distance by those &#x201c;spooky&#x201d; means. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen therefore felt that quantum mechanics would be superseded by some future theory that would make sense of the case of the correlated particles. <br><br>Physicists around the world had barely looked up from their calculations. Years went by, and it became more and more obvious that despite some odd details, ignored like the eccentricities of ...</p><h2>Rapture</h2><p>The effortless virtuosity, drama, and humanity of Carol Ann Duffy's verse have made her much-admired&nbsp;among contemporary poets.

Ronda&#x2019;s second marriage was dissolving after less than a year, her career as a pioneering female Washington State Trooper had ended, but she was optimistic about starting over again. "I&#x2019;m actually looking forward to getting on with my life," she told her mother earlier the night before. "I just need a few days with you guys." Barb Thompson, Ronda&#x2019;s mother, who had met her daughter&#x2019;s second husband only once before, was just happy that Ronda was coming home. </p><p>At 6:20 that morning, Ron Reynolds called 911 and told the dispatcher his wife was dead. She had committed suicide, he said, although he hadn&#x2019;t heard the gunshot and he didn&#x2019;t know if she had a pulse. EMTs arrived, detectives arrived, the coroner&#x2019;s deputy arrived, and a postmortem was conducted. Lewis County Coroner Terry Wilson, who neither visited the death scene nor attended the autopsy, declared the manner of Ronda&#x2019;s death as "undetermined." Over the next eleven years, Coroner Wilson would change that manner of death from "undetermined" to "suicide," back to "undetermined"&#x2014;and then back to "suicide" again. </p><p>But Barb Thompson never for one moment believed her daughter committed suicide. Neither did Detective Jerry Berry or ballistics expert Marty Hayes or attorney Royce Ferguson or dozens of Ronda&#x2019;s friends. For eleven grueling years, through the ups and downs of the legal system and its endless delays, these people and others helped Barb Thompson fight to strike that painful word from her daughter&#x2019;s death certificate. </p><p>On November 9, 2009, a precedent-setting hearing was held to determine whether Coroner Wilson&#x2019;s office had been derelict in its duty in investigating the death of Ronda Reynolds. Veteran true-crime writer Ann Rule was present at that hearing, hoping to unbraid the tangled strands of conflicting statements and mishandled evidence and present all sides of this haunting case and to determine, perhaps, what happened to Ronda Reynolds, in the chill still of that tragic December night.</p></p><p><b>Ann Rule</b> is a former Seattle policewoman and the author of more than two dozen <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers.

When Isabel comes into a large, unexpected inheritance, she is finagled into a marriage with the charming, penniless, and&#x2014;as Isabel finds out too late&#x2014;cruel and deceitful Gilbert Osmond, whose connection to a certain Madame Merle is suspiciously intimate. On a trip to England to visit her cousin Ralph Touchett on his deathbed, Isabel is offered a chance to free herself from the marriage, but nonetheless chooses to return to Italy.

Even yet she felt, did Mrs. Osmond, the awful surge and rhythm of the train&#x2019;s wheels, beating on and on within her. It was as if she were still seated at the carriage window, as she had sat for what seemed impossibly many hours, gazing with unseeing eyes upon the placid English countryside flowing away from her endlessly in all the soft- green splendour of the early- summer afternoon. Her thoughts had sped along with the speeding train but, unlike the train, to no end. Indeed, she had never registered so acutely the mind&#x2019;s unstoppable senseless headlong rush as she had since leaving Gardencourt. The great snorting and smoking brute that had paused with brusque impatience at the meek little village station and suffered her to take her place in one of its lattermost compartments&#x2014; her fingertips still retained the impression of hot plush and greasy leather&#x2014; now stood gasping after its mighty efforts under the high, soot- blackened glass canopy of the throbbing terminus, disgorging on to the platform its complement of dazed, bedraggled travellers and their jumbles of baggage. Well, she told herself, she had arrived somewhere, at least.<br><br>Staines, her maid, had hardly stepped down from the train before she flew into an altercation with a red- faced railway porter. Had she not been a female it might have been said of Staines that she was a fellow with a heart of oak. She was tall and gaunt, a person all of angles, with long wrists and large feet, and a jaw that put one in mind of the blade of a primitive axe. In the years that she had been in Mrs. Osmond&#x2019;s employ, or, given how closely they were conjoined, better say in the years that they had been together, Staines&#x2019;s devotion to her mistress had not wavered by a jot. In their long period of exile in the south her forbearance had extended to putting up with the Italian market and the Italian kitchen, and, which required an even more saintly fortitude, with Italian plumbing. Indeed, such was her steadfastness that on occasion Mrs. Osmond&#x2014; Isabel&#x2014;found herself longing wistfully for even half a day&#x2019;s respite from her servant&#x2019;s unrelenting, stone-hard solicitude. In their recent travels together the chief token and proof of Staines&#x2019;s loyalty had been a permanently maintained state of vexedness, not only in face of the impudence of porters, cab- drivers, boot-boys and the like, but also against what she considered her mistress&#x2019;s wilful credulousness, deplorable gullibility and incurably soft heart. Now, as the maid, her bonnet fairly wagging from the force of her indignation, stood berating the porter for unspecified shortcomings&#x2014;as a Londoner she was exercising her right to quarrel with her own kind, in her own city&#x2014;Isabel moved away with that wide-eyed blandness of manner she had perfected over the years at the scenes of so many similar confrontations between Staines&#x2019;s will and the world&#x2019;s recalcitrance.<br><br>She longed for the hotel and its stilly-breathing cool and shadowed spaces, in which she might sit perfectly immobile for a long time and let her reeling mind run down of its own accord. She would rest if only she could stop thinking, but how to effect that marvellous trick? The death of her cousin Ralph Touchett on a recent eve in his mother&#x2019;s house at Gardencourt&#x2014;extraordinary to reflect that there had been an exact, measurable moment, marked by a click on the clock, when for him eternity had begun&#x2014; had left her with a hard task to solve, like an exercise in geometry or algebra. The solution she was required to derive was no more or less than to find a fit mode by which to mourn the young man&#x2019;s passing. In truth, her cousin could no longer have been described as young, but that was how she thought of him, and no doubt how she would think of him always. Perhaps that was the main part of her difficulty, that it seemed a scandal to shed tears for a person whose life had been so marked by the slow vastation of a wasting illness that he could hardly have been said to have had a life at all. Thinking this, she at once chided herself. Who was she to judge the quality of any life, however brief or burdened? Behind the chidden thought, however, lay a darker, irrepressible formulation, which was, that the intensest living Ralph had done he had done through her, by way of a passionate vicariousness, watching in smiling wonderment from his seat at the ringside her breath- taking flights, her spangled swoopings, to and fro in the powdery light high up, oh, so high up, under the big, the tremendous, top. To have lived through someone else, even someone he professed to adore, that had been the height of Ralph&#x2019;s triumph, and the depth of his failure. How she wished now she had been capable of that greatness he had hoped for in her, those loftier leaps, those ever more graceful pirouettes in mid- air, those weightless landings on one braced toe, those sweeping bows with swan&#x2019;s- neck arms widespread. If she had lifted him up, she had also let him down. What he could not have expected, what he could not have imagined possible for one so firmly balanced as she, was the great, the catastrophic plunge from airy heights that had been precipitated by her marrying the perfectly wrong person.<br><br>Behind her now she heard an unmistakably solid step, and a moment later Staines loomed at her shoulder, her scant plumage ruffled and crackling, and she readied herself for the inevitable rebuke.<br><br>&#x201c;Why, there you are, ma&#x2019;am!&#x201d; the maid said loudly, for she had a voice as large and forceful as the rest of her. &#x201c;I was looking for you everywheres among all this pushing and pulling crowd.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I merely walked on,&#x201d; Isabel mildly protested, offering a mitigating smile. Staines, however, was in no mood to be mollified, and her mistress waited, almost with interest, to know how she herself should be implicated in that recent struggle on the platform, of which she had experienced no more than a hard glare from the porter&#x2019;s soiled eye and a muffled oath directed at her departing back.<br><br>&#x201c;The gall of that fellow!&#x201d; the maid said now, puffing out her cheeks in the way she did when she was wroth. &#x201c;Well, he got a piece of my mind, I can tell you.&#x201d; Here she made a marked pause, as she notched the barb to her bow-string, and when she resumed it was in a tone seemingly more of regret than reproval. &#x201c;Of course, if he&#x2019;d have known you was in mourning I have no doubt he would have presented a very different attitude.&#x201d;<br><br>This time Isabel reserved her smile to herself. The maid&#x2019;s veiled yet pointed reference was to the dispute she and her mistress had engaged in, before departing Gardencourt, over the matter of a mourning band, a dispute in which, unusually, the more determined of the two combatants had been forced to concede. It was to all intents a perfectly acceptable circlet of black crape that the servant had proffered, with a matchingly solemn mien, and it was a question as to which of them had been the more surprised when Isabel had declined, politely but firmly, to allow itto be pinned high up about the sleeve of her travelling coat. After a second of shocked silence the maid had begun to remonstrate, but her remonstrances proved to no avail; it was one of those instances, few but momentous, when the mistress showed her steel and the maid prudently stepped back. Mrs. Osmond would not wear a mourning band, and that, incontestably, was that. Staines had sulked, of course, and had bided her time, until now, when her mistress&#x2019;s flashing blade was safely back in its scabbard and she could risk a retributive shot. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m sure,&#x201d; she said, with a sort of toss of the head in her tone, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure even a ruffian of his sort would have shown a bit of respect for a person&#x2019;s loss, if he&#x2019;d only of been able to see the evidence of it.&#x201d;<br><br>To this Isabel did not respond; she had found, over the years, that a remote and unemphatic silence was often the most effective counter to her maid&#x2019;s insinuative provocations. In truth, she was not certain herself why she had refused, to the point of vehemence, to have the thing on her sleeve. Perhaps it was that to her it would have been somehow to claim too much to make such publicity of her sorrow; that it would have been a breach of common decency&#x2014; a breach, even, of common modesty. On the other hand, she was sure Ralph himself would be only too delighted to behold her draped from top to toe in black bombazine, complete with jet veil and broad sash, but only so that he could tease her and laugh at her in his fond, ironical fashion. So perhaps, after all, she thought now, she should have consented to the harmless convention of the band, if only to afford Ralph&#x2019;s spirit a moment of amusement in the place he dwelt in now, that realm of shades where surely he would welcome the opportunity for even the most wan of smiles. He had given her so much, and had asked so little in return.<br><br>Coming out at last from the cinder- smelling confines of the station, she felt as if she had dived into some clear light vaporous medium that was at once more and less than air. She had lived for so long amid southern harshnesses that London looked to her almost immaterial, with no sharp edges to it at all. Even in sunlight, as now, the city had a pearly sheen, and its shadows were the deepest shade of mauve. The crowds, too, weaving their endlessly shifting tapestry to and fro before her, had to her eye a quality of dreamy vagueness, as if all these people, despite the determination of their step and the fixity of their forward gaze, were not entirely certain of their destination, as likewise they could not quite remember their setting-off place, and yet minded not at all, in either case. Already she felt smoothed down and soothed; she had not been aware, before arriving in it, how achingly she had yearned for the strangely tender accommodations of this great metropolis of the north. She did not know London, not with any intimacy; she had spent time here, on visits, but for the most part she had viewed it not through her own eyes but through the eyes of others&#x2014;those of her husband, of Ralph Touchett and his mother, of her friend Henrietta Stackpole; of painters, too, and of poets and novelists&#x2014;so many!&#x2014; the Dickenses and Thackerays, the Byrons and the Brownings, all the bards who had sung to her, in the far-off city of Albany where she had passed the years of her youth, of this magically distant Land of Cockaigne.<br><br>Before she discerned the man himself her ear was caught by the sound of his weeping. It was a strange, unhuman sound, and at first she looked about for some wounded creature nearby, a fledgling gull, perhaps, fallen from the edge of some high parapet and mewling for its mother. But, no, it was a man. He was burly and broad but not at all strong-looking,with a big box-shaped head and hair of a fiery ginger shade and curly ginger whiskers. He had positioned himself at the corner of the wide thoroughfare that led the way out of the station precincts. She did not think she had ever seen or heard a grown man crying like this, copiously, helplessly, unstaunchably. His washed- blue eyes were red- rimmed, and his swollen and glistening nether lip trembled like a baby&#x2019;s. He wore a collarless shirt, an ancient pair of moleskin trousers shiny with grime, and a jacket of rusty serge that was much too small for him and pinched him under the arms and left his frail white wrists defencelessly exposed. He stood in one spot but kept turning his body first in one direction and then the other, caught it seemed in a trance of convulsive indecision. Beside him on the pavement was a shapeless bundle of something tied up in a knotted rag. It had seemed at first he was wearing shoes, but now that Isabel looked more closely she saw that his feet were bare but thoroughly caked with black, tar- like dirt. The coppery brightness of his whiskers, through which dark glinting rivulets of tears were coursing, and the pulpy paleness of his lightly freckled skin, somehow added to and intensified, for her, the sorrow and abjection of the spectacle he made; it was as if he had been flayed of a protective integument, and his flaming hair were blushing for him to be so nakedly and shamefully on show.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, look, that poor creature!&#x201d; she breathed, laying a hand on her maid&#x2019;s arm to stay her. &#x201c;We must do something to help him.&#x201d;<br><br>Staines, however, was unimpressed, and barely cast a glance in the direction of the weeping man where he stood sobbing and shaking and rocking. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no helping them as can&#x2019;t help themselves,&#x201d; she said, with a sniff, and went resolutely on, despite her mistress&#x2019;s restraining touch. Isabel, after a moment&#x2019;s hesitation, had no alternative but to follow her, albeit with a troubled heart. It was strange&#x2014; surely Staines, who most likely had sprung from the same depths of society as had the weeping man, was the one in whom the urge to render him succour should have been strongest, instead of which she had turned her face against him, with lips compressed into a white line. And yet it was understandable, after all: the maid&#x2019;s instincts were those of a still uninfected person spurning a doomed victim of the plague. To Isabel, however, whose store of bullion in the bank guaranteed her immunity, it was plain that her duty lay precisely in helping such as he, the unfortunate and fallen ones of the world. But the rules were the rules: they applied in both directions, downwards as well as upwards, and she knew the impossibility of disobeying her servant and going to the weeping man even if it were for no more than to press a coin shamefacedly into his hand.<br><br>In the hansom cab, the choosing of which was a right Staines naturally arrogated to herself, Isabel sat hard by the open window to have the benefit of what freshness the city air could offer. After her moment of mild exaltation on exiting the station she had relapsed once more into her former state of diminished numbness. The lingering rhythm of the train was replaced by the harshing of the cab&#x2019;s steel-rimmed wheels on the metalled roadway. She viewed the panorama of the city passing in the window as if it were a running series of exhibits under glass. She felt dulled and dazed, like one who after a long illness is taken out for a supposedly invigorating &#x201c;spin.&#x201d; They had crossed the park and come out into the cacophonous bustle of Knightsbridge. She glanced at Staines sitting opposite her, stiffly upright with her big jaw stolidly set and her sceptical gaze fixed upon the passage of brightly bedecked shop-fronts.&#x201c;Are you happy to be amid familiar sights?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;I mean, are you happy to be home, even if only briefly?&#x201d;<br><br>The maid turned upon her a stare as stony as adamant. &#x201c;What, you mean London?&#x201d; she said. She gave herself a scornful sort of twitch, bridling her bony shoulders. &#x201c;This&#x201d;&#x2014; directing the tip ofher sharp nose at the fashionable parade of parasols and silk hats along the busy pavement&#x2014;&#x201c;this is not my London, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br><br>To this rebuff Isabel responded with her smile of practised vagueness, and once again retreated into herself, as into the folds of a capacious, all- covering cape. She could never be annoyed with Staines, not fully; she knew that what appeared in the young woman a large, unremitting and ill- tempered disdain was no more than a mask for an incapacity to show her ever- marvelling appreciation of Isabel&#x2019;s tolerance and loyalty. For the maid loved her mistress, incoherently, inexpressibly, and would be willing, as she might say herself, to walk barefoot over burning coals, if thereby she might strike up for Isabel a spark of needed warmth. Acknowledging this fact to herself for the thousandth time, Isabel found her thoughts turning back to the somehow related matter of the weeping man. It was true, she had never witnessed a grown-up human being display in public such helple...</p><h2>Brisingr Deluxe Edition (The Inheritance Cycle)</h2><p><i>Experience the bestselling phenomenon of&nbsp;</i>Brisingr,&nbsp;<i>now in a deluxe edition!<br></i><br>This deluxe edition includes deleted scenes, never-before-seen art by the author, and a guide to dwarf runes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Following the colossal battle against the Empire's warriors on the Burning Plains, Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, have narrowly escaped with their lives.

He lives in California. <br> <br> Read on for Williams and Christopher Paolini's discussion about why they write fantasy, their upcoming projects, and more. <br> <br> <strong>Tad:</strong> Hi, Christopher. Nice to talk to you, albeit virtually. It was great hanging out with you and your family this summer. Pretty much all of us fell in love with your part of the world, too. <br> <br> Be warned: this isn't my best time of the day, so if I start calling you "Herman" and asking what it was about whaling that interested you, please forgive. <br> <br> The first thing I'd like to ask you as a starter question is: why fantasy? I mean, there's the obvious answer (which is also true for me) that it was something I loved to read growing up, but I guess I'm curious what is it that still resonates for you. Why do these kind of stories, these kinds of characters, these kinds of worlds, still speak to you? <br> <br> In a similar vein, do you have another kind of fiction, another genre, that you'd really like to try? If so, why? Any genres you think you'll never write but wish you could? <br> <br> <strong>Christopher:</strong> Hi Tad. Great talking to you as well. We all had a wonderful time when you guys visited. Definitely one Of the highlights of the year. <br> <br> I'm still waking up as well -- takes a few cups of tea and a few strips of bacon before the little gray cells start firing properly -- so if I sound a bit muddled, that's why. Still, we can make a stab at coherency, eh? <br> <br> Hmm. Why do I write fantasy? As you said, it's because I enjoy reading it, but I enjoy reading it because . . . well, for a number of reasons, I suppose. First of all, fantasy allows for all sorts of dangerous situations, and those can provide a lot of excitement in a story. And excitement is always fun. Also, epic fantasy usually deals with themes and situations that everyone can relate to, such as the challenge of growing up, or how one is supposed to deal with moral quandaries. Fantasy is the oldest form of literature; the very first stories that humans told while crouched around campfires were stories about gods and monsters and tragic mistakes and heroic feats. Even now, those topics still resonate with us on a primal level, which is one reason I think fantasy will remain popular with readers as long as humans are still human. And I love the sense of awe and wonder one can often find in fantastical literature. . . . Fantasy can allow you to see and hear and experience things that have never existed and never *could* exist. To me, that is the closest we come to real magic in this world. <br> <br> That said, there are a number of other genres I'd like to try my hand at: mystery, thriller, horror, science-fiction, romance, etc. I love stories of all kinds -- although mythic ones certainly hold the greatest appeal to me -- and I'm very much looking forward to experimenting once I finish the Inheritance cycle. Any genres I think I'll never write but wish I could? . . . Probably long-form epic poetry or a witty comedy of manners. Poetry is fun, but my grasp on it is rather shaky, and a comedy of manners (while I enjoy them) is so different from my usual life, I'm not sure I could pull it off properly. <br> <br> And now a question for you: You have just finished your third (large) series. What is it about big epic stories that so fascinates you? Why not write small, intimate books about a fishmonger whose greatest love is his toothpick sculpture of the Brooklyn Bridge? <br> <br> <b> Read the full conversation </b><b>Christopher Paolini </b>is the author of <i>Eragon </i>and <i>Eldest, </i>the first two books in the Inheritance cycle.

McKinley, K2, Makalu, Manaslu, and Everest-including his diary entries on the infamous 1996 disaster, written shortly after his return-are immortalized. There also are minute technical details about the skill of mountain climbing, as well as personal reflections on what life means to someone who risks it every day. Fully illustrated with gorgeous color photos, <i>Above the Clouds</i> is a unique and breathtaking look at the world from its most remote peaks.<br></p><p>Anatoli Boukreev was (with G. Weston DeWalt) coauthor of <i>The Climb</i> and a world-renowned high-altitude mountaineer. Twenty-one times he reached the summit of the world's highest mountains. For his heroic actions on Mount Everest in May 1996, he was awarded the American Alpine Club's highest honor, the David A. Sowles Memorial Award. <br><br>Linda Wylie was Anatoli Boukreev's companion and is now executor of his estate.<br>Born in Mayak, Russia, in 1958, Boukreev became one of the world's greatest mountain climbers. But while his accomplishments included 21 ascents of 11 of the world's 14 highest mountains, Boukreev became known to the general public only after his work as a guide on a disastrous Mt. Everest climb was described in less than glowing terms in Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. Boukreev's coauthored bestselling account of the tragedy, The Climb, was an attempt to set the record straight. This new posthumous collection is a series of narratives Boukreev wrote between 1987 and his death climbing Annapurna in 1997; it stands as an excellent addition to The Climb and as one of the most revealing and tough-minded descriptions of the life of a mountain climber. Three themes dominate the essays: the spiritual beauty and power of the mountains, the increasing commercialization of mountain climbing and the necessity for rigorous training by people (pros and newcomers alike) who want to climb the big mountains. The accounts collected and edited by his companion Linda Wylie capture Boukreev's thoughts during an often troubled period: by 1989, at the height of his powers, Boukreev had received the highest sports honors in Soviet history, but when the Soviet Union collapsed, Boukreev was forced to move to America, where he made his living as a guide for wealthy patrons on private climbing adventures including the terrible Mt. Everest trip, which haunted him until he died. 32 pages of photos not seen by PW. (Nov. 16)Forecast: The bestselling status of Boukreev's first book as well as continuing interest in the 1996 attempt to climb Mt. Everest should promise sizable, serious readership.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Vocabulary Cartoons: Sat Word Power</h2><p>First complete collection of rhyming word and visual mnemonic aids for rapid vocabulary enhancement.

To convey their social status, gentleman soldiers stationed abroad ordered entire suites of the ingeniously designed, elaborately styled, fold-up furnishings, and manufacturers such as Chippendale, Sheraton, and Hepplewhite furiously competed for commissions. In the first-ever book on the subject, Nicholas A. Brawer meticulously details this fascinating merger of commerce and craftsmanship. <p>Featuring more than 250 photographs organized by furniture type, the images include &#x201c;before and after&#x201d;series depicting items in packed and assembled states. A comprehensive directory of makers will prove invaluable to collectors, dealers, and military buffs.</p></p><p>"The first axiom for camp is... do not make yourself uncomfortable for want of things to which you are accustomed," advised <i>The Complete Indian Housekeeper and Cook</i> in 1890 to high-born Brits living in India, most of which England had by that point colonized through a succession of wars, or military "campaigns," throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. This impeccably curated, insightfully narrated, and richly illustrated volume proves that the homesick subjects of the Raj took such advice deeply to heart. It showcases nearly 200 years of furniture designed expressly to approximate all the refinement of a proper British household inside the canvas tents of ranking officers afar, but also to break down and fold up fast for easy, compact transport (hence campaign furniture's other appellation, "knock-down" furniture). Masterfully put together by independent curator Brawer, previously a researcher in the Indian and Southeast Asian departments of London's venerable Victoria and Albert Museum, this handsome volume succeeds on two levels: it amply highlights the stylistic elegance and technical ingenuity of this kind of furniture--a bureau that becomes a bed when its drawers are removed; a lady's bidet that folds into a leather case; or a dining table seating 20 that fits inside a 10-inch-deep box--while putting it (often quite wryly) in the historical context of an expatriate society that sought to re-create Britain wherever it went and had little or no interest in adapting to or learning about the customs or designs of the people it conquered (and essentially enslaved). Throughout, Brawer includes excerpts from a fascinating array of letters, journals, and other documents of the period, and an excellent pictorial directory of the furniture's craftsmen and manufacturers helps make this impressive tome invaluable for collectors, design historians, Anglophiles, and Merchant-Ivory set designers alike. <i>--Timothy Murphy</i>NICHOLAS A.

Though ever striving for variety in his roles, York is best known in the States as a leading man and, as is Cabaret, as the passive support for other characters. In England, he has played Romeo, Hamlet, and Cyrano, and since then has made his belated but well-received Broadway debut in Tennessee Williams's two-character play Out Cry. Born in 1942 in the village of Fulmer, he was the son of a serving RAF officer, and later businessman, whose wife was six years older. He showed an early gift for acting, which was fed by the Oxford University Dramatic Society and developed professionally in the Dundee Repertory, then seen to flower modestly in Olivier's National Theatre. York made an early transition to film, first appearing in Zeffirelli's The Taming of the Shrew, Harold Pinter- Joseph Losey's Accident, a 13-part BBC-TV version of The Forsyte Saga, and again with Zeffirelli in his gloriously mounted Romeo and Juliet as fiery young Tybalt. York married young, to Pat McCallum, an American photographer, honeymooned in India while serving in his first Merchant-Ivory production. After George Cukor's failure Justine, in which he played Durrell's narrator Darley, his film career crested in Bob Fosse's Cabaret, which was followed by spirited work in Richard Lester's Musketeer films and Marty Feldman's The Last Remake of Beau Geste. But what can be said of such duds as the musical remake of Lost Horizon? Perhaps York's most recent success was with Michael Gambon in the BBC-TV version of Elizabeth Bowen's The Heat of the Day, with its Pinter script. York writes at leisurely length (like Cottrell on Olivier), is always affable, warm-spirited, evenhanded, seldom memorable, and never brilliant. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Wes Moore graduated from a difficult childhood in the Bronx and Baltimore to an adult life that would find him at some of the most critical moments in our recent history: as a combat officer in Afghanistan; a White House fellow in a time of wars abroad and disasters at home; and a Wall Street banker during the financial crisis. In this insightful book, Moore shares the lessons he learned from people he met along the way&#x2014;from the brave Afghan translator who taught him to find his fight, to the resilient young students in Katrina-ravaged Mississippi who showed him the true meaning of grit, to his late grandfather, who taught him to find grace in service.<br> &nbsp;<br> Moore also tells the stories of other twenty-first-century change-makers who&#x2019;ve inspired him in his search, from Daniel Lubetzky, the founder of KIND, to Esther Benjamin, a Sri Lankan immigrant who rose to help lead the Peace Corps. What their lives&#x2014;and his own misadventures and moments of illumination&#x2014;reveal is that our truest work happens when we serve others, at the intersection between our gifts and our broken world. That&#x2019;s where we find the work that lasts.<br> &nbsp;<br> An intimate narrative about finding meaning in a volatile age, <i>The Work </i>will inspire readers to see how we can each find our own path to purpose and help create a better world.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>The Work</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>&#x201c;Powerful and moving . . .

As my eyes darted from one glossy picture to the next, I noticed that the young woman sitting to my right was gripping the armrest between us with a desperate ferocity, as if our safe landing were dependent on her hanging on to the support. She stared straight ahead, not blinking, not flinching. At one point she flicked her eyes in my direction and I gave her what I hoped was a reassuring smile, wanting to soothe her but not come off as weird. After a moment her face softened and she returned the smile. As if a trance had broken, her shoulders relaxed and the death grip she had on the armrest eased. She looked at me and said in an English accent, &#x201c;I guess everything has changed.&#x201d;<br><br>I arrived at London&#x2019;s Heathrow Airport on September 23, 2001, on one of the first transatlantic flights granted airspace after the attacks of September 11, 2001. What should have been an unexceptional flight was filled with passengers afraid to sleep, instead sitting rigid and vigilant for the six-hour journey, like soldiers standing their post. I was right there with them, fighting off the idea that kept reappearing somewhere in my mind that this flight might be my last. I had just turned twenty-three.<br><br>The passengers applauded the crew as the plane touched down on the runway at Heathrow, a ritual likely shared on aircrafts around the world that day, and we all collectively breathed a sigh of relief. This at first seemed odd to me, the idea of applauding someone for successfully accomplishing their job. Nobody applauds the garbage collector as they patrol a neighborhood collecting overstuffed bags filled with the week&#x2019;s trash. Nobody applauds the taxi driver as they pull to a stop and yank the receipt from the meter. But the repeated images emblazoned into our minds, planes that took off but never landed, reminded us of the miracle of landing. The hundreds of people onboard, including me, sat patiently and waited for the seat belt light to be turned off, and then gratefully filed off the plane. Everyone was unusually polite and deferential--very different from the usual mosh pit that forms in the aisle when it&#x2019;s time to disembark. While I would later learn that in other countries, applause for a safe landing is a kind of ritual, that day at Heathrow the clapping was something different. I smiled again at my new British friend seated next to me as we headed together toward baggage claim. Her smile back was one of relief.<br><br>Along with thirty other passengers on that plane, I was headed to Oxford University, one of the oldest and most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the world, but my mind swirled with grief for the lives taken too soon.<br>Less than two weeks earlier, September 11, 2001, had been my little sister&#x2019;s twenty-first birthday. I was scheduled to have a meeting that day at Morgan Stanley, whose offices were in one of the towers, but I&#x2019;d moved it to September 13 because my mother and I decided to surprise my sister for her birthday. Mom and I were in the car, driving up from Baltimore to New Jersey, where my sister lived, when we began to get the news. By the time the second tower fell, we knew we would never make it to New Jersey. Once we were able to confirm that my sister was safely at home, we turned around and drove home.<br><br>I&#x2019;d done work, through the military, on the rise and ramifications of radical Islamism before September 11. I&#x2019;d done research on South America&#x2019;s tri-border region, the lawless area between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay where Islamist terrorists were suspected to train, and I had closely followed the events around the suicide bombing of the USS Cole that killed seventeen American servicemen. I wasn&#x2019;t one of these people that had never heard of the group Al-Qaeda before. Still, I had no idea this was coming or what it was when it first went down. I was a reserve officer, not exactly privy to the National Security Council&#x2019;s daily briefing. But my years of military training told me this much: I knew that when the first reports came in from Washington saying &#x201c;we are going to respond,&#x201d; that could only mean one thing: we were going to war.<br>When our plane landed in London on September 23, all of the passengers sat patiently and waited for the seat belt light to be turned off, then gratefully filed off the plane. Everyone was unusually polite and deferential--very different from the usual center-aisle mosh pit that forms when it&#x2019;s time to disembark. Our countries would soon be at war, but in the moments after the towers fell, there was this: small pockets of unprecedented peace.<br><br>This was the context in which I opened the next stage of my life. Part of me wondered if I was making the right choice. I was leaving behind my family and friends, including my mother. I was leaving behind my home country, which was still reeling from a terrorist attack, while starting a new life far away from the people whom I loved the most and who depended on me. I had an unbelievable opportunity in England, but I never felt more American than the moment I left it.<br>My American Journey was, not coincidentally, the name of one of the most influential books I&#x2019;d ever read. When I was a teenager attending military school, few books offered me the opportunity to see myself--and my potential--the way Colin Powell&#x2019;s autobiography did. The book was published in the aftermath of the first war in Iraq, but before his beleaguered term as secretary of state, when he helped usher in the second Iraq War. When I read the book, my sense of politics was hazy at best, but what drew me to it were the stunning similarities between our early journeys.<br><br>Like me, Powell hailed from Jamaican roots. He was born in New York and I was born in Maryland, but we were both raised in the Bronx. We were both shaped by our military experience. My short time around the military--as a cadet in military school--had changed me. It gave me more discipline and direction, but more than that, it provided me with a kind of brotherhood that I had never imagined would be possible. I suspected the same was true for Powell, who had reached the highest rank the Army had to offer: a four-star general and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<br><br>One big difference between us--aside from the fact that Powell was among the most famous people in the world and I was an anonymous teenager--was that Powell was a father, whereas I was a son. In his book, Powell tells of a letter he wrote each of his children when they turned sixteen. My own father was not alive and could not write me such a letter, so I took Powell&#x2019;s advice as if it had come from my own dad:<br><br>You now begin to leave childhood behind and start on the road to manhood. . . . You will establish definitively the type person you will be the remaining fifty years of your lifetime. You know what is right and wrong and I have confidence in your judgment. Don&#x2019;t be afraid of failure. Be more afraid of not trying. . . . Take chances and risks--not foolhardy actions, but actions which could result in failure, yet promise success and reward. And always remember that no matter how bad something may seem, it will not be that bad tomorrow.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t be afraid of failure. Take chances and risks. Have confidence in your judgment. I thought of those words on the morning of September 23, 2001. To me the lesson in those words was that life will throw opportunities of all kinds at you--but it&#x2019;s up to you to use your judgment and take the risks of seizing the opportunities that make the most sense. The risk is that you might fail, but, as General Powell said, &#x201c;no matter how bad something may seem, it won&#x2019;t be that bad tomorrow.&#x201d;<br>Just before I left for graduate school in England, I attended something the Rhodes Trust called &#x201c;Bon Voyage Weekend,&#x201d; a chance for the newly selected Rhodes Scholars to meet their fellow scholars and learn more about the opportunities ahead; a time to celebrate, but also to find out the price of the ticket. As for the literal price, we were told that the bills for the two- or three-year adventure in Oxford, England, would be taken care of. Flights to and from the United States, covered. Travel expenses to see the world--as long as it had to do with our research--were expensed. Adults who were already changing the world rushed over to congratulate us for hardly doing much more than having good grades and potential. We were in our early twenties, most of us barely old enough to drink legally and still not old enough to handle our liquor, as we&#x2019;d go on to prove nightly once we got to Oxford.<br><br>We listened intently as Admiral Stansfield Turner, former director of the CIA, and Joseph Nye, former chairman of the National Intelligence Council and father of the international relations theory of neoliberalism, spoke on how the Rhodes Scholarship helped to prepare them for careers spent shaping national security in our nation for a generation. We laughed as former senator (and NBA star) Bill Bradley shared comical stories about trying to fit his six-foot-seven-inch frame through Oxford&#x2019;s ancient doorways, built in a shorter age. We all rushed to take pictures with Bill Clinton, the former Rhodes Scholar who had just left the Oval Office after completing his twenty-four-year career in elected office.<br><br>But of course 9/11 had happened just two weeks earlier, and even amid the celebrations and camaraderie, the events of that day hung over everything. We were being inducted into a prestigious fellowship, but there was also a sense in which we were being enlisted into an urgent though undefined battle. This was underlined one night when we all sat quietly as we shared a meal with Solicitor General Ted Olson, a man who was still deep in mourning and who painfully recounted the story of the last phone conversation he had had with his wife, Barbara Olson, on board American Airlines Flight 77 en route to Los Angeles, a plane that had been flown instead into the Pentagon on 9/11. Once she realized the plane was being hijacked, she called her husband, unaware of the other two planes that had already flown into the World Trade Center in NYC. She called him to tell him the plane had just been commandeered; she wondered what she should do. Then the line went dead. The fact that Olson came to speak to us while still mourning the sudden death of his wife was a testament to how important he thought it was to send us off with a strong sense of duty to our country&#x2019;s new, undefined mission.<br><br>It was already clear, just from that weekend, that the Rhodes Trust was giving me access to a world that was pretty unrecognizable compared to anything I&#x2019;d seen before. I felt overwhelmed and undeserving, the arbitrary recipient of a golden ticket to a secret world, a school so old it has no official founding date (records indicate that teaching at Oxford existed as early as 1096). When I told my friends back home about the fancy hotels and dinners and the VIPs who lined the walls of every room we entered, they listened and smiled with pride but weren&#x2019;t sure exactly what to say. I was disoriented and hoping that someone could help me make sense of it. And the most remarkable thing about this was that there was no catch. No hidden cameras recording it all as a social experiment, no small writing at the bottom of the contract, no unwritten rules we all would learn about the hard way. This was a world where they made only two requests of you. The first was clear and concise: to learn. This learning wasn&#x2019;t the same as the grade-grubbing that had defined so much of our academic lives to that point. In fact, for many of the classes I would take over there, pass/fail was standard. The mandate to learn simply meant to come back a different person than the person you were when you arrived. More deeply informed, more cultured, more prepared.<br><br>The second request was a bit more enigmatic. The scholarships were established in 1903 and outlined four criteria to be used in the selection of the scholars:<br><br>� Literary and scholastic attainments.<br><br>� Energy to use one&#x2019;s talents to the full.<br><br>� Truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness, and fellowship.<br><br>� Moral force of character and instincts to lead, and to take an interest in one&#x2019;s fellow beings.<br><br>In his will, Cecil Rhodes stated distinctly that he wanted the scholars &#x201c;to fight the world&#x2019;s fight.&#x201d; None of us were sure exactly what that meant. When a mentor of mine, Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke, first encouraged me to apply for the Rhodes Scholarship, he made it clear that he wanted me to know who Cecil Rhodes was before applying to accept his money. Mayor Schmoke, a brilliant and often radical black man--he famously pushed for decriminalization of drugs at the height of the drug-fueled epidemic of violence in Baltimore--walked me through the life and crimes of Rhodes. I hadn&#x2019;t known anything about Rhodes before that conversation, but since then I have never forgotten who he was.<br><br>Cecil Rhodes was born in 1853 in England, and made his name and fortune in southern Africa as one of the founders of the diamond mining company DeBeers. He died young, as one of the richest men in the world. He left a legacy of bold entrepreneurialism and aggressive wealth accumulation, but of course he&#x2019;s remembered for more than that. Cecil Rhodes was also a brutal and violent racist whose extreme tactics to control black labor and undermine black sovereignty went hand in hand with his unabashed belief in Anglo-Saxon supremacy.<br><br>Southern Africa, with its wealth and its vicious racism, was then in many ways a mirror of Rhodes. I had had a bit of personal experience with South Africa. As an undergraduate, I studied abroad in the townships outside of Johannesburg, where I got to see firsthand how black people still struggled to overcome the legacy of apartheid. I also had a connection through my grandfather, Papa Jim. In the 1960s, he had been appointed the first black minister in the more than three-hundred-year history of the Dutch Reformed Church, which was also the official religion of apartheid South Africa. He often told us about the racist death threats he received as his reward. After his appointment, church leaders asked him to lead a delegation of clergy to South Africa. Upon arriving in Johannesburg, he was informed by state security that the airport was as far as he would be allowed to go--he would not be permitted to leave the terminal. Eventually the party he was supposed to meet and stay with in South Africa had to come to him. They conducted their meeting in the airport terminal, where my grandfather prayed with them--for change, for hope, for unity, for forgiveness, for freedom. After that my grandfather promptly left that murderous regime and returned to America.</p><h2>Kovels&#39; American Silver Marks</h2><p>What the Kovels don't know about antiques," says <i>House Beautiful</i>, "isn't worth knowing."

Like <i>The Island of Lost Maps,</i> his bestselling book about a legendary map thief, <i>Painter in a Savage Land</i> is a compelling search into the mysteries of the past. This is the thrilling story of Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues, the first European artist to journey to what is now the continental United States with the express purpose of recording its wonders in pencil and paint. Le Moyne&#x2019;s images, which survive today in a series of spectacular engravings, provide a rare glimpse of Native American life at the pivotal time of first contact with the Europeans&#x2013;most of whom arrived with the preconceived notion that the New World was an almost mythical place in which anything was possible.<br><br>In 1564 Le Moyne and three hundred other French Protestants landed off the coast of Florida, hoping to establish the first permanent European settlement in the sprawling territory that would become the United States. Their quest ended in gruesome violence, but Le Moyne was one of the few colonists to escape, returning across the Atlantic to create dozens of illustrations of the local Native Americans&#x2013;works of lasting importance to scholars. Today, he is also recognized as an influential early painter of flowers and plants.<br>A Zelig-like persona, Le Moyne worked for some of the most prominent figures of his time, including Sir Walter Raleigh. Harvey&#x2019;s research, moreover, suggests a fascinating link to the notorious Mary Queen of Scots. Largely forgotten until the twentieth century, Le Moyne&#x2019;s pieces have become increasingly sought after in the art world&#x2013;at a 2005 auction, a previously unknown book of his botanical drawings sold for a million dollars.<br>In re-creating the life and legacy of Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues, Miles Harvey weaves a tale of both intellectual intrigue and swashbuckling drama. Replete with shipwrecks, mutinies, religious wars, pirate raids, and Indian attacks, <i>Painter in a Savage Land</i> is truly a tour de force of narrative nonfiction.<br><br>Praise for <i>Painter in a Savage Land</i> <br><br><b>"Inspired, beautiful, and wholly original.

Historian Harvey (The Island of Lost Maps, 2000) marvels at the &#x201c;epic strangeness&#x201d; of his subject&#x2019;s complicated life story. Le Moyne was the first artist sent to North America when he set sail from Le Havre in 1564 with 300 men sent to stake a claim for France in Florida but fated to suffer starvation and violent death. Le Moyne not only survived and returned home;&nbsp;he also managed to create marvelously stylized drawings of the tragically doomed Timucuan people. He then escaped religious persecution in France and found sanctuary in London, where he became a leading botanical artist and advisor to Walter Raleigh. It&#x2019;s one astonishing discovery after another&nbsp;as Harvey retrieves the buried truth about Le Moyne and chronicles the nearly miraculous preservation of his work. With hugely entertaining side journeys, energetic analysis, and a diabolical surprise ending, Harvey&#x2019;s groundbreaking, fun-to-read biography blows the dust off significant swathes of history and makes for a rousing read. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Jessi Ramsey, Pet-Sitter (Baby-Sitters Club, No. 22)</h2><p>Receiving a desperate call from the Mancusi family, Jessi takes on an unusual sitting job caring for three dogs, five cats, two birds, a cage of hamsters, guinea pigs, fish, a snake, rabbits, and turtles.

Unlike most of the rock &amp; rollin' fantasies that have ripped off Ms. Bull's concept, <i>War for the Oaks</i> is well worth reading.

And the way he keeps nodding and flicking his Zippo open and closed in rhythm with his head. He belongs in a chorus line of dancing Jets and Sharks.<br>Then again, I have an eye for these things. I know what to look for, because I&#x2019;ve seen just about every variety of spook and specter you can imagine.<br>The hitchhiker haunts a stretch of winding North Carolina road, bordered by unpainted split-rail fences and a whole lot of nothing. Unsuspecting drivers probably pick him up out of boredom, thinking he&#x2019;s just some college kid who reads too much Kerouac.<br>&#x201c;My gal, she&#x2019;s waiting for me,&#x201d; he says now in an excited voice, like he&#x2019;s going to see her the minute we crest the next hill. He taps the lighter hard on the dash, twice, and I glance over to make sure he hasn&#x2019;t left a ding in the panel. This isn&#x2019;t my car. And I&#x2019;ve suffered through eight weeks of lawn work for Mr. Dean, the retired army colonel who lives down the block, just so I could borrow it. For a seventy-year-old man he&#x2019;s got the straightest back I&#x2019;ve ever seen. If I had more time, I could&#x2019;ve spent a summer listening to interesting stories about Vietnam. Instead I cleared shrubs and tilled an eight-by-ten plot for new rosebushes while he watched me with a surly eye, making sure his baby would be safe with this seventeen-year-old kid in an old Rolling Stones t-shirt and his mother&#x2019;s gardening gloves.<br>To tell the truth, knowing what I was going to use the car for, I felt a little guilty. It&#x2019;s a dusk blue 1969 Camaro Rally Sport, mint condition. Drives smooth as silk and growls around curves. I can&#x2019;t believe he let me take it, yard work or no. But thank god he did, because without it I would have been sunk. It was something the hitchhiker would go for&#x2014;something worth the trouble of crawling out of the ground.<br>&#x201c;She must be pretty nice,&#x201d; I say without much interest.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, man, yeah,&#x201d; he says and, for the hundredth time since I picked him up five miles ago, I wonder how anyone could possibly not know that he&#x2019;s dead. He sounds like a James Dean movie. And then there&#x2019;s the smell. Not quite rotten but definitely mossy, hanging around him like a fog. How has anyone mistaken him for the living? How has anyone kept him in the car for the ten miles it takes to get to the Lowren&#x2019;s Bridge, where he inevitably grabs the wheel and takes both car and driver into the river? &nbsp;Most likely they were creeped out by his clothes and his voice, and by the smell of bones&#x2014;that smell they seem to know even though they&#x2019;ve probably never smelled it. But by then it&#x2019;s always too late. They&#x2019;d made the decision to pick up a hitchhiker, and they weren&#x2019;t about to let themselves be scared into going back on it. They rationalized their fears away. People shouldn&#x2019;t do that.<br>In the passenger seat, the hitchhiker is still talking in this faraway voice about his girl back home, somebody named Lisa, and how she&#x2019;s got the shiniest blond hair and the prettiest red smile, and how they&#x2019;re going to run off and get married as soon as he gets back hitching from Florida. He was working part of a summer down there for his uncle at a car dealership: the best opportunity to save up for their wedding, even if it did mean they wouldn&#x2019;t see each other for months.<br>&#x201c;It must&#x2019;ve been hard, being away from home so long,&#x201d; I say, and there&#x2019;s actually a little bit of pity in my voice. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;ll be glad to see you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, man. That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m talking about. I&#x2019;ve got everything we need, right in my jacket pocket. We&#x2019;ll get married and move out to the coast. I&#x2019;ve got a pal out there, Robby. We can stay with him until I get a job working on cars.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I say. The hitchhiker has this sadly optimistic look on his face, lit up by the moon and the glowing dashlights. He never saw Robby, of course. He never saw his girl Lisa, either. Because two miles up the road in the summer of 1970, he got into a car, probably a lot like this one. And he told whoever was driving that he had a way to start an entire life in his coat pocket.<br>The locals say that they beat him up pretty good by the bridge and then dragged him back into the trees, where they stabbed him a couple of times and then cut his throat. They pushed his body down an embankment and into one of the tributary streams. That&#x2019;s where a farmer found it, nearly six months later, wound around with vines, the jaw hanging open in surprise, like he still couldn&#x2019;t believe that he was stuck there.<br>And now he doesn&#x2019;t know that he&#x2019;s stuck here. None of them ever seem to know. Right now the hitchhiker is whistling and bobbing along to nonexistent music. He probably still hears whatever they were playing the night they killed him.<br>He&#x2019;s perfectly pleasant. A nice guy to ride with. But when we get to that bridge, he&#x2019;ll be as angry and ugly as anyone you&#x2019;ve ever seen. It&#x2019;s reported that his ghost, dubbed unoriginally as the County 12 Hiker, has killed at least a dozen people and injured another eight. But I can&#x2019;t really blame him. He never made it home to see his girl, and now he doesn&#x2019;t want anyone else to get home either.<br>We pass mile marker twenty-three&#x2014;the bridge is less than two minutes away. I&#x2019;ve driven this road almost every night since we moved here in the hopes that I would catch his thumb in my headlights, but I had no luck. Not until I got behind the wheel of this Rally Sport. Before this it was just half a summer of the same damn road, the same damn blade tucked under my leg. I hate it when it&#x2019;s like that, like some kind of horribly extended fishing trip. But I don&#x2019;t give up on them. They always come around in the end.<br>I let my foot ease up on the gas.<br>&#x201c;Something wrong, friend?&#x201d; he asks me.<br>I shake my head. &#x201c;Only that this isn&#x2019;t my car, and I don&#x2019;t have the cash to fix it if you decide to try to take me off the bridge.&#x201d;<br>The hitchhiker laughs, just a little too loudly to be normal. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ve been drinking or something tonight, pal. Maybe you ought to just let me off here.&#x201d;<br>I realize too late that I shouldn&#x2019;t have said that. I can&#x2019;t let him out. It&#x2019;d be my luck that he&#x2019;d step out and disappear. I&#x2019;m going to have to kill him while the car is moving or I&#x2019;ll have to do this all over again, and I doubt that Mr. Dean is willing to let the car go for too many more nights. Besides, I&#x2019;m moving to Thunder Bay in three days.<br>There&#x2019;s also the thought that I&#x2019;m doing this to this poor bastard all over again. But that thought is fleeting. He&#x2019;s already dead.<br>I try to keep the speedometer over fifty&#x2014;too fast for him to really consider jumping out, but with ghosts you can never be sure. I&#x2019;ll have to work fast.<br>It&#x2019;s when I reach down to take my blade out from under the leg of my jeans that I see the silhouette of the bridge in the moonlight. Right on cue, the hitchhiker grabs the wheel and yanks it to the left. I try to jerk it back right and slam my foot on the brake. I hear the sound of angry rubber on asphalt and out of the corner of my eye I can see that the hitchhiker&#x2019;s face is gone. No more easy Joe, no slicked hair and eager smile. He&#x2019;s just a mask of rotten skin and bare, black holes, with teeth like dull stones. It looks like he&#x2019;s grinning, but it might just be the effect of his lips peeling off.<br>Even as the car is fishtailing and trying to stop, I don&#x2019;t have any flashes of my life before my eyes. What would that even be like? A highlight reel of murdered ghosts. Instead I see a series of quick, ordered images of my dead body: one with the steering wheel through my chest, another with my head gone as the rest of me hangs out the missing window.<br>A tree comes up out of nowhere, aimed right for my driver&#x2019;s side door. I don&#x2019;t have time to swear, just to jerk the wheel and hit the gas, and the tree is behind me. What I don&#x2019;t want to do is make it to the bridge. The car is all over the shoulder and the bridge doesn&#x2019;t have one. It&#x2019;s narrow, and wooden, and outdated.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not so bad, being dead,&#x201d; the hitchhiker says to me, clawing at my arm, trying to get me off the wheel.<br>&#x201c;What about the smell?&#x201d; I hiss. Through all of this I haven&#x2019;t lost my grip on my knife handle. Don&#x2019;t ask me how; my wrist feels like the bones are going to separate in about ten seconds, and I&#x2019;ve been pulled off my seat so that I&#x2019;m hovering over the stick shift. I throw the car into neutral with my hip (should have done that earlier) and pull my blade out fast.<br>What happens next is kind of a surprise: the skin comes back onto the hitchhiker&#x2019;s face, and the green comes back into his eyes. He&#x2019;s just a kid, staring at my knife. I get the car back under control and hit the brakes.<br>The jolt from the stop makes him blink. He looks at me.<br>&#x201c;I worked all summer for this money,&#x201d; he says softly. &#x201c;My girl will kill me if I lose it.&#x201d;<br>My heart is pounding from the effort of controlling the lurching car.

Innovation has been fueled by technology (with developments such as multicolored dry rub-off transfers); by environmental concerns (with nonwovens, or vlies, that breathe and create no harmful residues); and by a profusion of retro, luxury, naturalistic, humorous, and artistic ideas.<br><br> First published in 1994, <em>The Papered Wall</em> has been revised to include a new and fully illustrated chapter on recent trends and a thorough reworking of its invaluable reference section, including suppliers of historic patterns and collections open to the public.<br><br> Written by experts from Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, and the United States, this authoritative volume begins with the individually printed sheets that formed the first wallpapers in the fifteenth century. It encompasses English flocked papers with repeats as large as seven feet, spectacular French panoramas encircling an entire room, and exquisitely printed bowers of roses. By 1900 technical inventiveness and designers like William Morris had put new kinds of wall coverings and a vast choice of patterns before a worldwide market. The twentieth century saw a struggle between traditional ideas and radically "modern" styles&#x2015;Jugendstil, Art Deco, Bauhaus, and postwar contemporary designs.<br><br> Complete with a guide to care and conservation, this is a timely, informative, and stimulating record of wallpapers for every use and taste. 369 illustrations, 216 in color</p><p>Lesley Hoskins is a Specialist Curator at the Museum of Domestic Design &amp; Architecture, Middlesex University, and a curator in the field of nineteenth- and twentieth-century interiors and wallpapers.</p><h2>A New World Order Is Coming: Who Will Rule?</h2><p>"Peace, peace, we must have peace at any cost," is the cry being heard from every quarter today.

A Woman&#39;s Book of Choices chronicles the history of ME, the currently accepted standard of ME practice, and its legal ramifications, and offers accounts of actual ME procedures. It also describes the who range of other abortion alternatives, from state-of-the-art clinical abortions to folk remedies, for women who may be considering terminating a pregnancy. In addition, there is a comprehensive chapter that is directed to medical personnel who may be providing abortion care, and a chapter on the French-developed abortion pill, RU-486.</p><p>REBECCA CHALKER is the author of The Clitoral Truth: The Secret World At Your Fingertips and A Woman&#39;s Book of Choices. She teaches Women&#39;s and Gender Studies at Pace University in New York City where she teaches a course on the cultural history of sexuality.Authors Chalker ( The Complete Cervical Cap Guide ) and Downer (charged in 1972 for practicing medicine without a license after applying a yogurt antidote to a yeast infection) may have written the ultimate guerilla guide to reproductive choices. In an era when a woman's access to health care is determined increasingly, and arbitrarily, by age, race, health insurance, socio-economic status and geography--as of 1990, 82% of the counties in the U.S. did not have an abortion provider--this book helps to even the odds. It tells you how to find and evaluate an abortion clinic, where to go for low- or no-interest loans to finance an abortion and what a woman's options for ending a pregnancy were before 1973. Personal accounts of doctors and women here depict some harrowing pre- Roe experiences and some inspiring grassroots initiatives, such as the group of University of Chicago students who launched a clandestine abortion referral service in a dorm room in 1964. In the final chapters of the book, Chalker and Downer look to the future of RU-486, the controversial abortifacient, and cover a selection of dangerous folk remedies that don't work, as well as some herbs and remedies that do, according to the authors. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Diana: Her True Story in Her Own Words</h2><p>The sudden and tragic death of Princess Diana caused the world to reflect on how much this singular woman meant to us all. This new edition of her life story -- which includes Diana's personal recollections in her own words, as well as an account of the events surrounding her death -- poignantly strengthens her hold on our hearts. <p> From her fairy-tale wedding and the births of her two wonderful boys to the stunning collapse of her marriage, Diana's luminous but troubled life transfixed millions. Despite enduring heartbreak, illness, and depression, she never wavered in her commitment to the less fortunate, or in her determination to make a better life for herself and her sons. This revealing book is the closest we will ever come to her autobiography -- a lasting and powerful testament to her courage and spirit.</p></p><p><i>Diana: Her True Story</i> was originally published in 1992 under the guise of a quasi-authorized biography, with mostly unnamed courtiers and royalty as the accredited sources. It instantly became a sizzling, international bestseller that lanced the boil of Windsor family dysfunction, triggering a chain of events that led to Charles and Diana's divorce. After her tragic death in 1997, Andrew Morton revealed that Diana herself had not only been the main source for the book, but had also edited his original drafts for accuracy. In return for this gold mine of information, Diana wanted complete anonymity for fear of retaliation from the queen. <i>Her True Story in Her Own Words</i> is enhanced by more than 75 full-color photographs of the princess, from her childhood in Althorp to her marriage to Charles at Westminster Abbey to her humanitarian efforts, and finally to her unforgettable funeral service. However, the most poignant portrayal of the princess emerges from the unedited transcriptions of Diana's interviews with Morton: "I think I'm going to cut a very different path from everyone else. I'm going to break away from this setup and go and help the man on the street."<p>The sudden and tragic death of Princess Diana has caused the entire world to reflect on how much this singular woman meant to us all. From her fairy-tale courtship, her wedding to Prince Charles, and the birth of her two wonderful boys to the stunning collapse of her marriage and the revelation of her psychological and physical trauma, we witnessed and shared in the wide range of emotions in her life. In the last few years, Diana's dedication to the downtrodden and unloved and her commitment as a mother have only strengthened her hold on our hearts. </p><p>When <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> was initially published in 1992, it was met with a hail of abuse from the British Establishment. As time passed, however, the magnitude of Diana's marital and personal distress made it clear, even to the greatest doubters, that this book was indeed Diana's true story; and finally, in 1995, she revealed in a BBC interview that she had indirectly cooperated with Andrew Morton. </p><p>What has not been known, however, until the publication of this new edition, is that <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> was in fact almost entirely based on her own words, supplemented by interviews with her friends. In 1991 and 1992, when this book was first conceived and written, Diana felt trapped and powerless within the royal family. She knew that the truth about her life was submerged under a mountain of royal propaganda. <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> chronicles Diana's unhappiness, which began shortly before her wedding day, and reveals the life of a young and beautiful woman who, trapped in a loveless marriage, had sunk to the depths of despair; from which recovery seemed impossible. In an act of desperation, she made the decision in 1991 to tell her own story, no matter what the cost. And so she and Andrew Morton began a collaboration that was to shake the royal family to its foundations and, eventually, force Diana to seek a new life. Tragically, that new, and briefly happy, life is over. </p><p>This new edition contains the story of how the book first came into being. What's more, Diana is able, finally, to tell her own story, in her own words. Its pages contain her own testament -- the closest we will ever come to her autobiography.</p></p><h2>The Quilter&#39;s Album of Blocks and Borders : More than 750 Geometric Designs Illustrated and Categorized for Easy Identification and Drafting</h2><p>The Quilter's Album of Blocks &amp; Borders is the most comprehensive, most usable collection of patchwork designs ever assembled. Each of the over 750 geometric designs, illustrated and categorized for easy identification and drafting, is drawn in clear, artistic detail, and there are scores of tips for innovative uses of fabric, many of which are graphically demonstrated. In this book, patterns are not only indexed by their various names but also organized according to their type of design. The categorization, such as fourpatch or seven-patch or hexagonal, is the revolutionary system that Mrs. Beyer set out in her first and instantly popular book, Patchwork Patterns. In this companion volume, she has compiled and categorized more than 1,000 quilt names. And she has included a handy seethrough plastic insert printed with a grid of each of the eight categories. By laying this grid sheet over the drawing of a block, you can easily match block to grid and thus see how to draft it. With this book Jinny Beyer becomes the first author to pay more than glancing attention to border designs; there are 145 included here. She also reveals the secrets of her own innovative and subtle use of fabrics, the hallmark of her prize-winning work. Her clear explanations and ingenious illustrations can teach more about combining fabrics than years of formal classes. In her effort to make her Album as comprehensive as it is well organized, Mrs. Beyer spent countless hours searching for the oldest published source for each pattern. Her sense of debt to generations of quiltmakers who have gone before &#x2013; usually unnamed and unsung &#x2013; is so deeply felt that she has dedicated this book to them. A truly useful dictionary, a pioneer attempt to document historical patterns, a survey of border designs plus an exciting short course on the effective use of fabrics -- all these contributions make The Quilter's Album of Blocks &amp; Borders a must for anyone who creates with geometric design.</p><p></p><h2>Classic Hand Tools</h2><p>Before the machine age, all woodworking and carpentry was done with hand tools, and an amazing variety of tools evolved for a wide range of tasks. Many of these tools are as elegant as they are ingenious, and Classic Hand Tools celebrates their great heritage in words and pictures.</p><p>Hack is a professional furniture maker. He is a regular contributor to Fine Woodworking magazine.Once upon a time, woodworkers had to rely upon hand tools exclusively; but recently, the development of power tools relegated hand tools to the status of quaint antiques. In this book, Hack, a contributor to Fine Woodworking and the author of The Handplane Book, rethinks their usefulness. He argues that hand tools are, in some cases, better than their motorized counterparts; they're both quiet and, because they lack motors and generate very little dust, relatively safe. He covers tools of all typesAchisels, planes, saws, hammers, and measuring devices, some plain and others fancy. Not as good as Aldren A. Watson's Hand Tools: Their Ways and Workings (Lyons, 1993. reprint.), this book does contain excellent chapters on making and restoring tools and on buying used toolsAand the wealth of beautiful photographs will make even the most casual woodworker salivate. An outstanding book, recommended for all public and academic libraries.AJonathan N. Hershey, Akron-Summit Cty.

While it is common knowledge that the US used Nazi scientists during the cold war, Hunt reveals for the first time that the project to recruit and utilize Nazi scientific talent- -code-named ``Paperclip''--continued until 1973. In addition, while former Nazi scientists (like Werner von Braun) contributed greatly to the development of rockets, jet planes, and other prodigies of technology, Hunt convincingly demonstrates that several such scientists also participated in ``Dachau-like experiments on over seven thousand U.S. soldiers'' on the effects of LSD and other chemicals at Edgewood, Maryland, between 1947 and 1966. Moreover, Hunt explains that the US avidly recruited many Nazi scientists, despite their war crimes--including utilization of slave labor and execution of prisoners--and despite the continuing devotion of many to Nazi ideology. Hunt also relates the sordid details of the intelligence community's attempts to prevent bringing these scientists to justice. And, in at least one case, she shows that the program was inimical to US interests--the man who conceived and ran Paperclip was ultimately convicted of selling American defense secrets to the Soviet Union. An engrossing examination of how a small clique of defense and intelligence officials deliberately subverted stated US policy.

The inn was called The Three Forts, and its sign depicted three tall fortresses with doors flung wide open. The name was taken from those fortresses built during the War of the Barons, in which the district had been much involved, that could be seen from the west end of town.<br>The village (and, consequently, the inn) was located in the wide valley between the Yendi and the Shallow Rivers, a region renowned for its wheat and maize fields and for the unique odor of its kethna farms. If we go on to say that Newmarket was in that portion of this valley which was located within the County of Sorannah, and that within the Duchy of Luatha, we hope we shall have identified the place well enough to satisfy all but the most exacting of our readers.<br>As for the village itself, it should be said that there was little to distinguish it from other villages in the area. That is, it had its inn, it had its leather-worker, it had its mill and bins. It had no sorcerer, but did have an augur and a healer. It had no steelbender, but did have a smith and wheelwright. It had no packing-house, but did have a smokehouse. It had no mayor, but did have its Speaker, with a low Speaker's House that was the only building of stone in the town. It had one street, that for half the year was mud and for the rest was the good, black soil of the district. It was near enough to the Imperial Highway that a coach came by the inn every morning and evening, but far enough away that it was a good refuge for the few bandits and highwaymen who dared to brave the wizards of the Athyra Guard, just lately retired with the turning of the Cycle from the Athyra to the Phoenix and with the ascension of the Emperor Tortaalik.<br>This day was the thirteenth of Tortaalik's reign, and this reign the eighteenth of the House of the Phoenix. The inaugural festivities still had four days to run their course. So it was that the young gentleman found Newmarket in a state of quiet and serene celebration.<br>This gentleman, to whom we now have the honor of returning, was, we should say, dusty. In those days, before the Interregnum, a gentleman who had been traveling on foot was easily seen to be poor. And yet he was surely of gentle birth. He had long, curly black hair, parted at his noble's point; soft brown eyes; and a rather long, pleasant face, distinguished by the creases in the forehead that show high intellect and by the strong chin that indicates determination and will. To these features, add high cheekbones, a proud nose, and a fair complexion, and it will be seen at once that he was not only a gentleman, but clearly of the House of the Tiassa--which was proved by the color of his garments, where they could be discerned beneath the dust he wore as his outer, and, no doubt, inner, layer of clothing.<br>His tunic was of white cotton, with puffed sleeves, and was drawn tight around the waist. He had a light woolen overtunic of pale blue with wide lapels. The tunic ended in a short flared skirt without fringe or tassel. Beneath, he wore hose of the same shade of blue, and lyornskin boots, undyed, with low heels and rounded toes. A chain of flat links around his waist held a light sword of good length. The chain also held a thong which ran from scabbard to belt, preventing the sword from scraping the ground when he walked, as well as a sheathed dagger next to the sword, and a purse on the opposite hip. The purse, upon close inspection, looked rather anemic.<br>He was of medium height, but well built and athletic-looking. He wore neither jewelry nor hat--this last because it had been lost in a gust of wind two days before. To round off our description, with which we hope our readers have not lost patience, we will say that he had a clear, friendly eye, an open countenance, and a frank, pleasant smile. With these things and a sword of good length, much can be done, as we will, by and by, endeavor to show.<br>The Tiassa, whose name was Khaavren, entered the inn, and stood for a moment to let his eyes adjust to the darkness. On one side was a table where sat the host, waiting for travelers. On the other was a single large room, lit by kerosene lamps and containing four long tables. At first glance, every chair seemed to be occupied, but a closer look revealed a few empty places in the farthest corner. Khaavren made his way there, smiling his apologies to a Jhegaala and a Chreotha, into whom he could not help bumping. Since the inaugural festivities continued, and since the Tiassa's countenance was one of friendliness, neither one was inclined to take offense, so he soon found himself seated on a plain, hard-backed wooden chair.<br>At length, he identified a servant who seemed to be keeping the patrons supplied with cheer. This servant, however, was on the other side of the room, so Khaavren relaxed, making up his mind to wait patiently. To pass the time, he looked around, his gaze slipping by the numerous Teckla to dwell on persons of more interest. To his right a wizard of the House of the Athyra sat drinking alone, staring into his cup, and, we must assume, thinking deep and subtle thoughts. Next to this wizard was a Vallista with her head on the table, snoring loudly. To Khaavren's left was an attractive young lady of the House of the Dzur, who was engaged in a game of three-copper-mud with a Lyorn and two Hawks. As Khaavren's eye was about to pass over them, the Dzurlord suddenly stood, a hand on the greatsword she carried over her shoulder. Several pairs of eyes turned to her as she frowned at one of the Hawklords. The Hawk at whom she stared seemed suddenly pale.<br>"My lady," he said in a raspy voice. "What troubles you?"<br>The Dzur, as Dzur will when in the presence of someone showing fear, allowed a smile to play about her lips. "It is very simple, my lord," said she, in a strong voice. "I have an amulet, given me by my uncle, Lord Tuaral." She paused here, evidently to see if the name produced an effect. When it didn't, she continued. "This amulet emits a small sound, which only I can hear, whenever sorcery occurs near it."<br>"I fail to see," said the Hawk, "how I am concerned with an amulet given you by your uncle."<br>"Ah, but you soon will."<br>"How so?"<br>"Well, this way: four times now, you have made very difficult throws. Twice, you managed three Thrones over my split high; once, you achieved three Orbs over my three Thrones; and now, just lately, you threw three Orbs followed by a split high after my three Orbs."<br>"That it true," said the Hawk. "But how does this concern your amulet?"<br>Khaavren, who saw things faster than the Hawklord pretended to, drew in his breath and leaned forward.<br>"It concerns the amulet," replied the Dzur, "in that at each of the throws I have just had the honor to describe, I have heard that sound. Had it been only once, I should have thought nothing of it. Even hearing it twice, no action would have been called for. But four times--come now, my lord. Four times is excessive, I think."<br>The Hawklord seemed to understand at last. His brows came together. "I almost think you accuse me," he said.<br>"Well, yes," said she.<br>He glanced around, then said to the other Hawklord, "Will you stand for me, my lord?"<br>"Gladly," said the other. Then the latter turned to the Dzur and said, "Have you a second?"<br>"I have no need," she said, "If this gentleman"--here she indicated the Lyorn next to her--"will be so kind as to judge for us."<br>The second Hawklord turned to the Lyorn. "My lord?"<br>Now, all this time there had been more and more interest in the proceedings from those nearby, until nearly everyone in the room was watching the interplay. But the Lyorn, who had been one of the players, had shown no sign of interest save for a slight, sad smile which flitted across his face, rather like the small, red daythief across an afternoon sky. When spoken to, however, he shrugged. Then he said to the Dzurlord, in a quiet, melodious voice, "Do you accuse?"<br>"I do," she answered, with a toss of her head that sent her dark hair from one side of her neck to the other.<br>He turned to the second Hawklord while pointing to the first. "Do you deny?" he asked.<br>They looked at each other, and the principal nodded. "He does," said the second.<br>"Well, then," said the Lyorn, and drained his glass in one motion, his throat bobbing smoothly. He set the glass down gently and stood up. "Perhaps the street," he suggested. He looked around, his eye coming to rest on Khaavren. "Would you care to draw the circle?"<br>Now, we would not be faithful to our role of historian if we did not say that Khaavren was young, and, moreover, had come from a noble family, albeit one that had fallen on hard times. He had been as well-educated as his poverty would permit, but the Fallen Nobility, as they were beginning to be called in that day, usually had little experience with the ways of Court, or even the ways of the more prosperous of the aristocracy; yet they invariably craved such knowledge and experience. A young gentleman, such as Khaavren, could hardly be made such a request without being delighted. He nodded.<br>Remembering what was involved as best he could, he walked out into the street, which was, fortunately, rather wide. He noted the size of the Dzurlord's blade, estimated the distance between the hostel on the one side and the livery stables on the other, and decided that it would do. He took more pains with his task because, in addition to other factors, he had been living far out in the country, and, in his ninety-five years, he had never been this close to a duel. To be sure, he had once, as a child, peeking over the stone wall that surrounded his home, had occasion to see his father beat a neighbor with the flat of his sword over some insult, but that was hardly the same as a duel, with all of the formalities that, like war, make legal and proper injury or death inflicted on one's fellow man.<br>As he was making his observations, the Dzurlord emerged, speaking to the Hawklord's second, apparently deciding on the terms of the engagement. The Lyorn came after them. Khaavren looked at the latter briefly, noticing the short, straight brown hair brushed back off a high forehead, the thin face, the small chin, small mouth, and hooked nose. These, along with the dark complexion, identify the Lyorn even without his costume. This Lyorn, who was very tall for one of his House, seemed to be a warrior, as he was wearing soft leather boots, a plain red blouse, and a brown skirt that came to his ankles. He had no visible weapon, but wore a pair of copper or bronze vambraces.<br>The Tiassa turned back to his task then, and drew his sword. He found a spot to make the corner, and lowered his blade to begin drawing the line. He was interrupted, then, by a low, soft voice near him: "No, not your sword."<br>He looked up and saw the Lyorn standing near his elbow.<br>"No?" he inquired.<br>"Use your knife," said the Lyorn.<br>"Why?" asked Khaavren.<br>The Lyorn smiled sadly. "Name?"<br>"Khaavren of Castlerock."<br>"Aerich," said the other, accompanying the word with a gesture to indicate himself.<br>"But," said Khaavren, "about the sword--"<br>Aerich gestured at the weapon's point. "This is your honor," he said. "It must never touch the ground. Use your knife."<br>Khaavren looked at Aerich for a moment, trying to decide if the Lyorn were jesting. But then, he thought, Aerich was the judge. He sheathed his sword, took out his dagger, and drew a line across the width of the street, then one along the side, twice seventeen paces in length, then crossed the street again, and back to where he had begun to complete the rectangle. He straightened his back with some relief and looked up at Aerich, who nodded solemnly.<br>Aerich turned and gestured to the combatants, indicating where they ought to stand. The Dzurlord removed her doublet and folded it carefully, setting it on the street outside of the circle. She drew her sword from behind her back. The weapon seemed close to her own height, yet she had no apparent trouble wielding it. The Hawk had a short broadsword, and a dagger in the other hand. Aerich looked at the Hawklord's second.<br>"Terms," he said.<br>The other Hawk frowned. "We have agreed--"<br>"State them aloud, please," said Aerich.<br>The Hawk nodded. "Plain steel weapons, sword and dagger, to first blood, no healer present, but a healer may be summoned at once upon conclusion."<br>Aerich looked an inquiry at the Dzurlord, who seemed disgusted, but nodded. The Lyorn stood between them, so they were each separated from him by five paces, and from each other by ten. He raised his hand.<br>"As your chosen Imperial intermediary, in accordance with the laws of the Empire, I ask if you will not be reconciled." His tone of voice indicated a certain lack of interest in the answer.<br>"No."<br>"No."<br>"Very well," he said, and lowered his hand in a motion that was at once graceful and sudden.<br>Both Hawk and Dzur seemed to be startled but the Dzur recovered first. With a yell, she sprang at her enemy, her blade visible only as a blur. The Hawklord barely had time to assume a defensive posture, and at once there was the ringing sound of steel on steel, which sent a thrill through Khaavren's heart.<br>The Hawk stepped back, and swung his blade wildly--and from so far away that Khaavren could see it was a useless gesture. The Dzur smiled contemptuously and stepped in, and, to Khaavren's inexperienced but expert eye, she moved with a grace and fluidity that would have made her a worthy opponent of his own sword-master.<br>With her next step, she beat aside the Hawklord's sword and, with the same motion, gave him a good cut across his right shoulder and down to his chest. The sound that came from his throat was more squeak than moan as he fell over backward, the point of her sword still lodged in his chest, breaking two ribs and nearly cutting open his lungs.<br>The Hawklord's weapons fell from his hands as he lay on the ground, staring upward in horror as the Dzur pulled her sword free and raised it for the killing stroke.<br>"Lady!" called Aerich, in a tone that was far sharper than Khaavren would have suspected possible from the quiet gentleman. It was used to good effect, too, as the Dzurlord stopped, looked at him, then sighed and nodded.<br>"Ah, yes," she said, with a hint of contempt in her voice. "First blood."<br>Then, turning her back on the fallen Hawklord, she walked back into the inn, stopping only to clean her blade and retrieve her doublet. The Hawk's second approached his principal and dropped to his knee, looking at the wound.<br>"A healer!" he cried.<br>The village healer, such as he was, was sent for, and Khaavren returned to the inn, following Aerich back to the same corner he had occupied earlier. They sat down next to the Dzur, who had already resumed her place with an air which indicated that die battle in which she had just been victorious was not even worth the trouble to discuss. Aerich picked up t...</p><h2>The Careful Use of Compliments: An Isabel Dalhousie Novel</h2><p><b>ISABEL DALHOUSIE - Book 4<br></b><br> <b>Nothing captures the charm of Edinburgh like the bestselling Isabel Dalhousie series of novels featuring the insatiably curious philosopher and woman detective.&nbsp; Whether investigating a case or a problem of philosophy, the indefatigable Isabel Dalhousie, one of fiction&#x2019;s most richly developed amateur detectives, is always ready to pursue the answers to all of life&#x2019;s questions, large and small.</b><br><br> In addition to being the nosiest and most sypathetic philosopher you are likely to meet, Isabel is now a mother. Charlies, her newborn son, presents her with a myriad wonders of a new life, and doting father Jamie presents her with an intriguing proposal: marriage. In the midst of all this, she receives a disturbing letter announcing that she has been ousted as editor of the <i>Review of Applied Ethics</i> by the ambitious Professor Dove.<br> <br> None of these things, however, in any way diminshes Isabel's curiosity. And when she attends an art auction, she finds an irresistable puzzle: two paintings attributed to a now-deceased artist appear on the market at the same time, and both of them exhibit some unusual characteristics. Are these paintings forgeries? This proves to be sufficient fodder for Isabel's inquisitiveness. So she begins an investigation... and soon finds herself diverging from her philosophical musings about fatherhood onto a path that leads her into the mysteries of the art world and the soul of an artist.</p><p><strong>A Message from Author Alexander McCall Smith</strong> <p></p> <b>Three great places to visit in Scotland:</b> <p></p> <b>The Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh</b><br> This gallery, housed in an extraordinary red sandstone building topped with spikes and twirls, contains a pictorial record of Scots over the ages--the handsome, the deluded, the unfortunate, the inventive--they&#x2019;re all there. <p></p> <b>Falkland Palace</b><br> A lovely little palace in lush countryside, where the father of Mary Queen of Scots turned his face to the wall and predicted the end of the Stuart dynasty. <p></p> <b>The Isle of Muck</b><br> You reach this charming little island on a tiny boat.

Now he flashes way back to reveal how Quarry got in the killing business. Naturally, it started in Vietnam, where ne&#x2019;er-do-well Quarry found something he was good at&#x2014;killing people; later, after a wrong turn or two back in the States, he hooks up with a broker who runs a murder-for-hire business. Quarry&#x2019;s first target: a philandering college professor whose latest conquest happens to be the coed daughter of a Chicago mafioso. Rationalizing that the prof is a dead man whether or not Quarry does the deed, our antihero takes the job. Like Lawrence Block in his hit-man series starring the similarly one-named Keller, Collins manages the neat trick of engendering sympathy for a killer by muddying the moral waters: plot complications change the terms of the deal, requiring Quarry to do his killing out of self-preservation rather than cold-blooded commerce. Either way, Collins knows the terrain, mixing pulp-style action with just enough character building to keep us going.

Evidently the Lord spake so as to be heard, and the disciples listened. The Holy Ghost has provided that not one petition should be lost to the church of God. We often find our Lord teaching His disciples to pray, and we read of Him spending even whole nights in prayer; but we never find Him praying with His disciples. Indeed, there would seem to be something incongruous in Christ kneeling down with His disciples for prayer; there must always have been something peculiar in His petitions.<br> <br> At this time His work on earth was well-nigh ended: nothing remained for Him but to die: &#x201c;I have finished the work which Thou gavest Me to do.&#x201d; (v. 4.)

He had washed their feet; He had comforted them; He had opened His whole heart to them. He now opens it for them to Him before whom &#x201c;all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid;&#x201d; and having poured out His soul into the ear, and into the bosom of God, He went forth into Gethsemane.

It is&nbsp;a book that only Kevin Barry would attempt, let&nbsp;alone succeed in pulling off&#x2014;a Hibernian high wire act of courage, nerve, and great beauty.</p><p>Kevin Barry is the author of the highly&nbsp;acclaimed novel<i> City of Bohane</i> and two short-story collections, <i>Dark Lies the Island</i> and <i>There Are Little Kingdoms. </i>He was awarded the Rooney Prize in 2007 and won the Sunday Times EFG Short Story Award in 2012. For <i>City of Bohane,</i>&nbsp;he was short-listed for the Costa First Novel Award and the Irish Book Award, and won&nbsp;the Author&#x2019;s Club Best First Novel Prize, the&nbsp;European Union Prize for Literature, and the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. His short fiction&nbsp;has appeared in <i>The New Yorker </i>and elsewhere.&nbsp;He lives in County Sligo in Ireland.He sets out for the place as an animal might, as though on some fated migration. There is nothing rational about it nor even entirely sane and this is the great attraction. He&#x2019;s been travelling half the night east and nobody has seen him&#x2014;if you keep your eyes down, they can&#x2019;t see you. Across the strung-out skies and through the eerie airports and now he sits in the back of the old Mercedes. His brain feels like a city centre and there is a strange tingling in the bones of his monkey feet. Fuck it. He will deal with it. The road unfurls as a black tongue and laps at the night. There&#x2019;s something monkeyish, isn&#x2019;t there, about his feet? Also his gums are bleeding. But he won&#x2019;t worry about that now&#x2014;he&#x2019;ll worry about it in a bit. Save one for later. Trees and fields pass by in the grainy night. Monkeys on the fucking brain lately as a matter of fact. Anxiety? He hears a blue yonderly note from somewhere, perhaps it&#x2019;s from within. Now the driver&#x2019;s sombre eyes show up in the rearview&#x2014;<br><br> It&#x2019;s arranged, he says. There should be no bother whatsoever. But we could be talking an hour yet to the hotel out there?<br><br> Driver has a very smooth timbre, deep and trustworthy like a newscaster, the bass note and brown velvet of his voice, or the corduroy of it, and the great chunky old Merc cuts the air quiet as money as they move.&nbsp;<br><br> John is tired but not for sleeping.<br><br> No fucking pressmen, he says. And no fucking photogs.<br><br> In the near dark there is the sense of trees and fields and hills combining. The way that you can feel a world form around you on a lucky night in the springtime. He rolls the window an inch. He takes a lungful of cool starlight for a straightener. Blue and gasses. That&#x2019;s lovely. He is tired as fuck but he cannot get his head down. It&#x2019;s the Maytime&#x2014;the air is thick with and tastes of it&#x2014;and he&#x2019;s all stirred up again.<br><br> Where the fuck are we, driver?<br><br> It&#x2019;d be very hard to say. He quite likes this driver.<br><br> He stretches out his monkey toes. It&#x2019;s the middle of the night and fucking nowhere. He sighs heavily&#x2014;this starts out well enough but it turns quickly to a dull moaning. Not a handsome development. Driver&#x2019;s up the rearview again. As though to say gather yourself. For a moment they watch each other gravely; the night moves. The driver has a high purple colour&#x2014;madness or eczema&#x2014;and his nose looks dead and he speaks now in a scolding hush:<br><br> That&#x2019;s going to get you nowhere.<br><br> Driver tips the wheel, a soft glance; the road is turned. They are moving fast and west. Mountains climb the night sky. The cold stars travel. They are getting higher. The air changes all the while. By a scatter of woods there is a medieval scent. By a deserted house on a sudden turn there is an occult air. How to explain these fucking things? They come at last by the black gleaming sea and this place is so haunted<br><br> <i>or at least it is for me<br></i><br> and there is a sadness, too, close in, like a damp and second skin. Out here the trees have been twisted and shaped by the wind into strange new guises&#x2014;he can see witches, ghouls, creatures-of-nightwood, pouting banshees, cackling hoods.<br><br> It&#x2019;s a night for the fucking bats, he says.<br><br> I beg your pardon?<br><br> What I mean to say is I&#x2019;m going off my fucking bean back here.<br><br> I&#x2019;m sorry?<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s all you can be.<br> &nbsp;<br> He lies back in his seat, pale and wakeful, chalk-white come�dian; his sore bones and age. No peace, no sleep, no meaning. And the sea is out there and moving. He hears it drag on its cables&#x2014;a slow, rusted swooning. Which is poetical, to a man in the dark hours, in his denim, and lonely&#x2014;it moves him. <br><br> Driver turns, smiling sadly&#x2014; <br><br> You&#x2019;ve the look of a poor fella who&#x2019;s caught up in himself. <br><br> Oh? <br><br> What&#x2019;s it&#x2019;s on your mind? <br><br> Not easy to say. <br><br> Love, blood, fate, death, sex, the void, mother, father, cunt and prick&#x2014;these are the things on his mind. <br><br> Also&#x2014; <br><br> <i>How many more times are they going to ask me to come on </i>The <i>fucking </i>Muppet Show<i>? <br></i><br> I just want to get to my island, he says. <br><br> He will spend three days alone on his island. That is all that he asks. That he might scream his fucking lungs out and scream the days into nights and scream to the stars by night&#x2014;if stars there are and the stars come through.</p><h2>The Encyclopedia of Illustration Techniques: A Step-By-Step Visual Directory of Illustration Techniques Inspirational Gallery of Finished Art Works</h2><p>Covers illustrating techniques from acyrlic to wood engraving, and gives advice for the illustrator who wants to become a professional</p><p></p><h2>Loneliness: It Can Be A Wilderness.

He lives in Bozeman, Montana.Grade 7 Up-This ambitious book succeeds on a number of levels. It is based on a true, tragic situation in which Petey, born with cerebral palsy in 1920, is misdiagnosed as mentally retarded. Unable to care for him at home, his parents relinquish him to the care of the state, where he languishes in a mental institution for the next five decades. Step by institutional step, readers see how this tragedy could happen. More importantly, readers feel Petey's pain, boredom, hope, fear, and occasional joy. A handful of people grow to know and love him over the course of his long and mostly difficult life, but few are able to effect much change. In 1977, statewide reorganization and a new, correct diagnosis result in Petey being moved to a local nursing home. There, the final, triumphant chapters of his life are entwined with an eighth-grade student named Trevor, who finds his own life transformed by love and caring in ways he never could have imagined. Mikaelsen successfully conveys Petey's strangled attempts to communicate. He captures the slow passage of time, the historical landscape encompassed. He brings emotions to the surface and tears to readers' eyes as time and again Petey suffers the loss of friends he has grown to love. Yet, this book is much more than a tearjerker. Its messages-that all people deserve respect; that one person can make a difference; that changing times require new attitudes-transcend simplistic labels. Give this book to anyone who has ever shouted "retard" at another. Give it to any student who "has" to do community service. Give it to anyone who needs a good book to read.<br><i>Joel Shoemaker, Southeast Jr. High School, Iowa City, IA</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>When the Heart Waits: Spiritual Direction for Life&#39;s Sacred Questions</h2><p>Book Club Edition of the popular book.</p><p></p><h2>Daily Roman Missal: Sunday and Weekday Masses for Proper of Seasons, Proper of Saints, Ritual Masses, Masses for Various Needs and Occasions, Votive Masses, Masses for the Dead</h2><p>This is the 1998 edition of the Roman Daily Missal.

Standing tall as always, angular features turned towards the horizon, his cloak wrapped tight against the seaward chill. My initial puzzlement at finding him here faded as I caught sight of the ship leaving the harbour, a narrow-hulled vessel of Meldenean design, sent to the Northern Reaches with an important passenger, one I knew he would miss greatly.</i></p><p><i>He turned to regard my approach, a tight, wary smile on his lips, and I realised he had lingered to witness my own departure. Our interactions since the relief of Alltor had been brief, somewhat terse in truth, distracted as he was by the ceaseless tumult of war and whatever malady had plagued him in the aftermath of his already legendary charge. The fatigue that turned his once-strong features into a sagging mask of red-eyed lethargy and his strident if coarse voice into a droning rasp. It had faded now, I could see. Recent battle seemed to have restored him somehow, making me wonder if he found some form of sustenance in blood and horror.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; he greeted me with a sketch of a formal bow then nodded at my prisoner. &#x201c;My lady.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Fornella returned the nod but gave no response, regarding him without expression as the salt-tinged wind tossed her hair, a single streak of grey visible amidst the reddish brown tumult.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I have already received ample instruction&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I began but Al Sorna waved a hand.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I come to offer no instruction, my lord,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Merely a farewell and my best wishes for your endeavour.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I watched his expression as he waited for a response, the wary smile smaller now, his black eyes guarded. </i>Can it be? <i>I wondered. </i>Is he seeking forgiveness?</p><p><i>&#x201c;Thank you, my lord,&#x201d; I replied, hefting the heavy canvas bag to my shoulder. &#x201c;But we have a ship to board before the morning tide.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Of course. I&#x2019;ll accompany you.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need a guard,&#x201d; Fornella said, her tone harsh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve given my word, tested by your truth-teller.&#x201d; It was true, we walked alone this morning without escort or formality. The reborn court of the Unified Realm had little time or inclination for ceremony.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Indeed, Honoured Citizen,&#x201d; Al Sorna replied in clumsy and heavily accented Volarian. &#x201c;But I have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. words for this grey-clad.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Free man,&#x201d; I corrected before switching to Realm Tongue. &#x201c;Grey-clad denotes financial rather than social status.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Ah, quite so, my lord.&#x201d; He stepped aside and gestured for me to continue along the wharf to the quay where the ships waited, a long line of Meldenean war galleys and traders. Naturally, our vessel was moored at the farthest end of the line.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Brother Harlick&#x2019;s gift?&#x201d; he enquired, nodding at the bag I carried.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Fifteen of the oldest books in the Great Library, those I could identify as useful in the small time allowed in his archives.&#x201d; In truth I had expected some argument from the brother librarian when I made my request, but the man had simply given an affable nod and barked an imperious order at one of his attendants to gather the requisite scrolls from the wagons that served as his movable library. I knew his apparent indifference to this theft was at least partly derived from his gift; he could always simply pen fresh copies, and openly since the need to keep such things hidden had disappeared. The Dark, as they called it, now revealed and discussed openly, the Gifted free to practice their talents without fear of swift torment and execution, at least in theory. I could see the lingering fear on the faces of those not so talented, and the envy, making me wonder if perhaps the wisest course would have been to keep the Gifted in the shadows. But could shadows ever linger in the fires of war?</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You really think he&#x2019;s in there somewhere?&#x201d; Al Sorna asked as we walked towards the ship. &#x201c;The Ally?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;An influence so malign and powerful is bound to leave traces,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;A historian is a hunter, my lord. Seeking out signs in the undergrowth of correspondence and memoir, tracking prey via the spoor of memory. I don&#x2019;t expect to find a complete and unbiased history of this thing, be it beast or man or neither. But it will have left traces, and I intend to hunt it down.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Then you should have a care, for I suspect it will not be blind to your attentions.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Nor yours.&#x201d; I paused, glancing at his profile, seeing a troubled brow. </i>Where is your certainty? <i>I thought. It had been one of his most aggravating traits during our previous association; the implacable, unshakeable surety. Now there was just a grim and troubled man weighed down by the prospect of trials to come.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Taking the capital will not be easy,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The wisest course would be to wait here, gathering strength until the spring.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Wisdom and war are rare bedfellows, my lord. And you&#x2019;re right, the Ally will most likely see it all.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Then why&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;We cannot simply linger here and wait for the next blow to fall. Any more than your Emperor can expect to remain immune from the Ally&#x2019;s attentions.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I am fully aware of what message to deliver to the Emperor.&#x201d; The leather satchel bearing the sealed scroll was heavy about my neck, heavier even than my bag of books, though only a fraction of its weight. </i>Just ink, paper and wax,<i> I thought.</i> Yet it could send millions to war.</p><p><i>We halted as we came to the ship, a broad-beamed Meldenean trader, her planking still scorched from the Battle of the Teeth, rails bearing the scars of blades and arrowheads, patches on the sails furled to the rigging. My eyes were also drawn to the serpentine figurehead which, despite having lost much of its lower jaw, retained a certain familiarity. My gaze found the captain at the head of the gangplank, thick arms crossed, his face set in a glower, a face I recalled all too well.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Did you, perhaps, have a hand in choosing this vessel, my lord?&#x201d; I asked Al Sorna.</i></p><p><i>There was a faint glimmer of amusement in his gaze as he shrugged. &#x201c;Merely a coincidence, I assure you.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I sighed, finding I had scant room in my heart for yet more resentment, turning to Fornella and extending a hand to the ship. &#x201c;Honoured Citizen. I&#x2019;ll join you in a moment.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I saw Al Sorna&#x2019;s eyes track her as she walked the plank to the ship, moving with her customary grace born of centuries-long practice. &#x201c;Despite what the truth-teller said,&#x201d; he told me, &#x201c;I caution you, don&#x2019;t trust her.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I was her slave long enough to learn that lesson myself.&#x201d; I hefted my bag once again and nodded a farewell. &#x201c;By your leave, my lord. I look forward to hearing the tale of your campaign&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You were right,&#x201d; he broke in, his wary smile returned once more. &#x201c;The story I told you. There were some&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. omissions.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I think you mean lies.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; His smile faded. &#x201c;But I believe you have earned the truth. I have scant notion of how this war will end, or even if either of us will live to see its end. But if we do, find me again and I promise you&#x2019;ll have nothing but truth from me.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I should have been grateful, I know. For what scholar does not hunger for truth from one such as he? But there was no gratitude as I looked into his gaze, no thought save a name. </i>Seliesen.</p><p><i>&#x201c;I used to wonder,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;how a man who had taken so many lives could walk the earth unburdened by guilt. How does a killer bear the weight of killing and still call himself human? But we are both killers now, and I find it burdens my soul not at all. But then, I killed an evil man, and you a good one.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I turned away and strode up the gangplank without a backward glance.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Lyrna</p><p>She was woken by the snow. Soft, icy caresses on her skin, tingling and not unpleasant, calling her from the darkness. It took a moment for memory to return and when it did she found it a fractured thing, fear and confusion reigning amidst a welter of image and sensation. <i>Iltis roaring as he charged, sword bared&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The ring of steel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A hard fist across her mouth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The man who burned her.</i></p><p>She opened her mouth to scream but could issue no more than a whimper, her subsequent gasp dragging chilled air into her lungs. It seemed as if she would freeze from the inside out and she felt it strange she should die from cold after being burned so fiercely.</p><p><i>Iltis!</i> The name was a sudden shout in her mind. <i>Iltis is wounded! Perhaps dead!</i></p><p>She willed herself to move, to get up, call for a healer with all the power her queen&#x2019;s voice could muster. Instead she barely managed to groan and flutter her hands a little as the snow continued its frosty caress. Rage burned in her, banishing the chill from her lungs. <i>I need to move! I will not die in the snow like a forgotten dog! </i>Drawing jagged air into her lungs again she screamed, putting every ounce of strength and rage into the sound. A fierce scream, a queen&#x2019;s scream&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but no more than a rattle of air through teeth when it reached her ears, along with something else.</p><p>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. better be a good reason for this, Sergeant,&#x201d; a hard voice was saying, strong, clipped and precise. A soldier&#x2019;s voice, accompanied by the crunch of boots in snow.</p><p>&#x201c;Tower Lord said he was to be minded well, Captain,&#x201d; another voice, coloured by a Nilsaelin accent, older and not quite so strong. &#x201c;Treated with respect, he said. Like the other folk from the Point. And he seems fairly insistent, much as I can gather from a fellow that don&#x2019;t talk above two words at a time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Folk from the Point,&#x201d; the captain said in a softer tone. &#x201c;To whom we have to thank for a snowfall at summer&#x2019;s end&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; His voice faded and the crunch of boots became the tumult of running men.</p><p>&#x201c;Highness!&#x201d; Hands on her shoulders, soft but insistent. &#x201c;Highness! Are you hurt? Do you hear me?&#x201d;</p><p>Lyrna could only groan, feeling her hands flutter once more.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Adal,&#x201d; the sergeant&#x2019;s voice, choked and broken by fear. &#x201c;Her face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have eyes, Sergeant! Fetch the Tower Lord to Brother Kehlan&#x2019;s tent! And bring men to carry his lordship. Say nothing of the queen. You understand me?&#x201d;</p><p>More boots on the snow then she felt something warm and soft cover her from head to foot, her benumbed back and legs tingling as hands lifted her. She fell into darkness, untroubled by the jolting run of the captain as he bore her away.</p><p>� � �</p><p>He was there when she awoke the second time, her eyes tracking over a canvas roof to find him sitting beside the cot where they had placed her. Although his eyes were tinged with the same red haze she had seen the day before, his gaze was brighter now, focused, the black eyes seeming to bore into the skin of her face as he leaned forward. <i>He burned me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </i>She closed her eyes and turned away from him, stilling the sob in her chest, swallowing and composing herself before she turned back, finding him kneeling beside the cot, head lowered.</p><p>&#x201c;Highness,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>She swallowed and tried to speak, expecting only a faint croak to emerge but surprising herself with a somewhat strident response. &#x201c;My lord Al Sorna. I trust the morning finds you well.&#x201d;</p><p>His head came up, the expression sharp, the black eyes still fierce. She wanted to tell him it was rude to stare, at a queen no less, but knew it would sound churlish. <i>Every word must be chosen,</i> her father had said once. <i>Each word spoken by the one who wears the crown will be remembered, often misremembered. So, my daughter, if ever you find this band of gold weighing upon your brow, never utter a single word that should not be heard from the mouth of a queen.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Quite&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, Highness,&#x201d; Vaelin responded, remaining on one knee as she stirred herself. To her surprise she found she could move easily. Someone had removed the dress and cloak she wore the night before, replacing the finery with a simple cotton shift that covered her from neck to ankle, the fabric pleasing on her skin as she sat and swung her legs off the cot to sit up. &#x201c;Please rise,&#x201d; she told Vaelin. &#x201c;I find ceremony tedious at the best of times, and of scant use when we&#x2019;re alone.&#x201d;</p><p>He stood, eyes never leaving her face. There was a hesitancy to his movements, a slight tremble to his hands as he reached for his chair, pulling it closer to sit opposite her, his face no more than an arm&#x2019;s length away, the closest they had been since that day at the Summertide Fair.</p><p>&#x201c;Lord Iltis?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Wounded but alive,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Also frostbitten in the small finger of his left hand. Brother Kehlan was obliged to take it off. He barely seemed to notice and it was quite the struggle to stop him charging forth to look for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was fortunate in the friends fate contrived to place in my path.&#x201d; She paused, drawing breath and courage for what she had to say next. &#x201c;We had little chance to talk yesterday. I know you must have many questions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One in particular. There are many wild tales abroad regarding your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. injuries. They say it happened when Malcius died.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Malcius was murdered, by Brother Frentis of the Sixth Order. I killed him for it.&#x201d;</p><p>She saw the shock hit home as if she had slashed him with an ice-cold blade. His gaze became distant as he slumped forward, speaking in a whisper. &#x201c;Wanna be a brother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wanna be like you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was a woman with him,&#x201d; Lyrna went on. &#x201c;Like your brother, playing the role of an escaped slave, come all the way across the ocean with a grand tale of adventure. From her reaction when I killed him, I suspect their bond was close.

But, as famed erotic photographer Bettina Rheims reveals in <i><b>Shanghai</b></i>, once visitors catch a glimpse of Shanghainese women, they will stand corrected. <br><br> Throughout China, the women of Shanghai are renowned for being beautiful and delicate creatures. But at home they are known as &#x201c;tricky wives&#x201d; who make their husbands do as they say. At the office, they are relentless professionals who display equal, if not more, competitiveness than the men. These women likewise take the lead all over China in fashion, displaying such decorous and audacious taste alike as to keep the country watching. <br><br>Once a walled village, Shanghai has now become China&#x2019;s leading industrial city, expanding in such a rush as to leave even its residents in a swirl of expectations. Shanghai is hip, trendy, and young, the city with the highest developing business rate in the world, a place of history and tomorrow and, as is amply evident in Shanghai, a very sexy place. In a tour de force through this ancient city and fabled culture, Rheims beautifully stages photographs of real women from all walks of life. Engaged in an ardent search for the spirit of Shanghai&#x2019;s women, Rheims and writer Serge Bramly instead found a place so fast-paced, so quickly evolving, that their quest was rendered moot. Western eyes could not define or encapsulate the ineffable essence of Shanghai&#x2019;s women. <br><br>So much can be said of the women in Shanghai, the least of which is the ancient Chinese proverb: &#x201c;Men have their say, but women have their way.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Bettina Rheims</b>, born in Paris in 1952, first exhibited her work in 1981 at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.

The first time she opened a book on the subject, in 1975, it was to discredit astrology and to prove to an acquaintance that astrology couldn't be believed. However, the first book she opened happened to show a little more than the usual sun sign descriptions and she found enough truth within those pages to convince her that there was indeed something to it. The surprising revelation that the planetary positions at our birth and their movements following birth are somehow synchronized with human events greatly excited her and it wasn't long before she realized she'd found her calling as she delved passionately into the art of astrology as a means by which to learn more about the meaning of life.</p> <p>Her goal is to promote astrology and teach astrologers the most valuable and reliable techniques for interpreting the horoscope.</p> <p>Celeste Teal has continually written for the popular astrology magazines since 1986.

This book, his 10th, offers 12 essays on the gardens, one for each month of the year. Lloyd weaves in family lore (his parents bought the property in 1910 and engaged Edwin Lutyens to design the garden), seasonal reflections ("Gives me a fine March day with the sound of flies and bees in the air and I'm on top of the world"), gardening opinions ("Much as I love daffodils, I unquestionably lean towards the crocuses because of the spontaneous way they open to sunshine") and practical tips ("Border phloxes need dead-heading"). The book is enjoyable when Lloyd describes the various flowers that surround his manor house. But he tends to bog down in minutiawill readers care that his mother wore "Austrian dirndl costume" for the last 36 years of her life? One hundred color photographs, many taken by the author, offer nice bits and pieces of the gardens.

Said to be one of J.R.R. Tolkien's childhood favorites, <i>The Princess and the Goblin</i> is the story of the young Princess Irene, her good friend Curdie--a minor's son--and Irene's mysterious and beautiful great great grandmother, who lives in a secret room at the top of the castle stairs. Filled with images of dungeons and goblins, mysterious fires, burning roses, and a thread so fine as to be invisible and yet--like prayer--strong enough to lead the Princess back home to her grandmother's arms, this is a story of Curdie's slow realization that sometimes, as the princess tells him, "you must believe without seeing." Simple enough for reading aloud to a child (as I've done myself more than once with my daughter), it's rich enough to repay endless delighted readings for the adult. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>George MacDonald was a prolific writer who enjoyed enormous success with his books for both adults and children.

More frolicsome than<i> Fowler's Modern Usage,</i> lighter than the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, and brimming with the strong opinions and razor-sharp wit that made Amis so popular--and so controversial--<i>The King's English </i>is a must for fans and language purists.<br></p><p>Kingsley Amis's <i>The King's English</i> is as witty and biting as his novels. Modestly presented as a volume "in which some modern linguistic problems are discussed and perhaps settled," Amis's usage guide is a worthy companion to his revered <i>Fowler's</i>. <i>The King's English</i> is distinctly British, but never mind: it is sensational. And unlike many of his countrymen, Amis is decidedly pro-American, even admitting a "bias towards American modes of expression as likely to seem the livelier and ... smarter alternative." In a world populated by usage mavens too willing to waffle, Amis is refreshingly unequivocal. On the expression <i>meaningful dialogue</i>? It "looks and sounds unbearably pompous. Nevertheless one would not wish to be deprived of a phrase that so unerringly points out its user as a humourless ninny." To cross one's 7's, he says, "is either gross affectation or, these days, straightforward ignorance." And the frequently misused word <i>viable</i>, he claims, "should be dropped altogether ... simply because it has taken the fancy of every trendy little twit on the look-out for a posh word for feasible, practicable." Forget Amis's protestations of being unfit for the position of language arbiter; after all, as he says, "the defence of the language is too large a matter to be left to the properly qualified." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>"Readers who missed, in our cautious times, old-fashioned invective will find Amis their man...This is entertaining, like an Amis novel." --<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><p> "Smart, witty and idiosyncratic" --<i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i></p><p> "A brilliant practitioner of English prose." --<i>Time</i></p><p> "Surprisingly non-stickling...[Amis] can blast with the best." --<i>L.A. Times</i></p><p> "Entertaining is not normally a word reserved for usage manuals. Leave it to Amis...to deliver a style manual laced with witty, acerbic commentary." --<i>Booklist</i> </p><p> "There may be more comprehensive guides to English usage but there will never be a more entertaining one.

Walker, aged 23 and fresh from college, was sent to Vietnam in the mid-1960s and was quickly absorbed into the famed 1st Infantry Division of the US Army, a.k.a. the ``Big Red 1.'' While most of his memoir focuses on the specific experiences of the armored cavalry, Walker is at his best when describing the daily routine of soldiers at war, as well as the welcome escapes from routine, such as a quick Christmas break from action to attend a Bob Hope performance. While Walker tends to digress with trite observations (``Bob Hope was not just an actor but an enduring symbol of America's appreciation for its servicemen''), his writing has a workmanlike character that gets his points across and carries the narrative through the flat spots until it reaches the next exciting point, such as the numerous action scenes, which Walker describes with gusto. Its unfortunate that he never manages to place his own experiences into a larger context of the war as a whole, particularly as he served during one of the pivotal stages of the war, when American involvement was reaching new levels of commitment every day. Also unfortunate is Walker's use of outdated, clichd images, such as his description of a Vietnamese barber as a ``grinning, gold-toothed tradesman,'' and even worse is his ending, a forced epilogue recounting one of his recurring postwar bad dreams. Alas, just another memoir that is likely to give many readers a sense of dj... vu. (photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The latest of Presidio's superior military memoirs reports the Vietnam experience of a career armor officer whose first combat was as leader of a platoon of M-48 tanks with the 1st Infantry Division in 1966. Walker faced not only formidable obstacles of terrain and stubborn opposition well provided with antitank weapons but also his superiors' doubt that armor had a place in Vietnam, which was manifested by failures in logistical and personnel support. He tells the vivid, moving story of how his unit survived and vindicated armor, inflicting more damage than it suffered. He also pays tribute to the men under him, politely damns uncooperative superiors, and doesn't withhold respect for the capabilities of the enemy when fighting on terrain and at times of his choice. Walker's book, the first platoon-level account of tank combat in Vietnam, is likely to rank permanently high among junior leadership and military coming-of-age stories of the Vietnam generation. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Wolf of the Plains (Conqueror, Book 1)</h2><p>paperback, vg++ In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p><p><b>Conn Iggulden</b> is the acclaimed author of the Emperor novels, which chronicle the life of Julius Caesar, and the Conqueror series, which is based on the lives of Mongol warlords Genghis, Ogedai, and Kublai Khan.

The eldest, Bekter, rode a gray mare with skill and concentration, and Temujin matched his pace, waiting for a chance to go past. Behind them came Khasar, whooping wildly as he moved up on the two leaders. At ten, Khasar was a favorite in the tribe, as lighthearted as Bekter was sullen and dark. His red-mottled stallion snorted and whickered after Bekter&#x2019;s mare, making the little boy laugh. Kachiun came next in the galloping line, an eight-year-old not given to the openness that made people love Khasar. Of all of them, Kachiun seemed the most serious, even secretive. He spoke only rarely and did not complain, no matter what Bekter did to him. Kachiun had a knack with the ponies that few others could match, able to nurse a burst of speed when the rest were flagging. Temujin glanced over his shoulder to where Kachiun had positioned himself, his balance perfect. He seemed to be idling along, but they had all been surprised before and Temujin kept a close eye on him.<br><br>Already some way behind his brothers, the smallest and youngest of them could be heard calling plaintively for them to wait. Temuge was a boy with too much love for sweet things and laziness, and it showed in his riding. Temujin grinned at the sight of the chubby boy flapping his arms for more speed. Their mother had warned against including the youngest in their wild tournaments. Temuge had barely grown out of the need to be tied to the saddle, but he wailed if they left him behind. Bekter had yet to find a kind word for Temuge.<br><br>Their high voices carried far across the spring grass of the plain. They galloped flat out, with each boy perched like a bird on the ponies&#x2019; backs. Yesugei had once called them his sparrows and looked on with pride at their skill. Temujin had told Bekter that he was too fat to be a sparrow and had been forced to spend a night hiding out from the older boy&#x2019;s bad temper.<br><br>On such a day, though, the mood of the whole tribe was light. The spring rains had come and the rivers ran full again, winding across plains where dry clay had been only days before. The mares had warm milk for drinking and making into cheese and cool yoghurt. Already, the first touches of green were showing through the bones of the hills, and with it came the promise of a summer and warm days. It was a gathering year, and before the next winter, the tribes would come together in peace to compete and trade. Yesugei had decreed that this year the families of the Wolves would make the trip of more than a thousand miles to replenish their herds. The prospect of seeing the wrestlers and archers was enough to have the boys on their best behavior. The races, though, were what held them rapt and played across their imaginations as they rode. Except for Bekter, the boys had all seen their mother privately, asking Hoelun to put in a word with Yesugei. Each of them wanted to race the long distance or the sprints, to make a name for themselves and be honored.<br><br>It went unspoken that a boy who returned to his gers with a title such as &#x201c;Exalted Rider&#x201d; or &#x201c;Master of Horse&#x201d; might one day win their father&#x2019;s position when he retired to tend his herds. With the possible exception of fat Temuge, the others could not help but dream. It galled Temujin that Bekter assumed he would be the one, as if a year or two of age made a difference. Their relationship had become strained ever since Bekter had returned from his betrothal year away from the tribe. Though Temujin was still the tallest of the brothers, the older boy had grown in some indefinable way, and Temujin had found the new Bekter a humorless companion.<br><br>It had seemed an act at first to Temujin, with Bekter only pretending at maturity. The brooding boy no longer spoke without thinking and seemed to weigh every statement in his mind before he allowed it past his lips. Temujin had mocked his seriousness, but the months of winter had come and gone with no sign of an easing. There were moments when Temujin still found his brother&#x2019;s pompous moods amusing, but he could respect Bekter&#x2019;s temper, if not his right to inherit their father&#x2019;s tents and sword.<br><br>Temujin watched Bekter as he rode, careful not to let a gap grow between them. It was too fine a day to worry about the distant future, and Temujin daydreamed about all four brothers, brothers&#x2013;all five with Bekter, even&#x2013;sweeping the board of honors at the tribal gathering. Yesugei would swell with pride and Hoelun would grip them one by one and call them her little warriors, her little horsemen. Even Temuge could be entered at six years of age, though the risks of a fall were huge. Temujin frowned to himself as Bekter glanced over his shoulder, checking his lead. Despite their subtle maneuvering, Yesugei had not yet given permission for any of them to take part as the spring came.<br><br>Hoelun was pregnant again and close to the end of her time. The pregnancy had been hard on her and quite different from the ones before. Each day began and ended with her retching over a bucket until her face was speckled with spots of blood under the skin. Her sons were on their best behavior while they waited for Yesugei to cease his worried pacing outside the gers. In the end, the khan had grown tired of their stares and careful silence, sending them off to run the winter out of the horses. Temujin had continued to chatter and Yesugei had picked him up in one powerful hand and tossed him at a stallion with a white sock. Temujin had twisted in the air to land and launch into a gallop in one movement. Whitefoot was a baleful, snappy beast, but his father had known he was the boy&#x2019;s favorite.<br><br>Yesugei had watched the others mount without a sign of his pride on his broad, dark face. Like his father before him, he was not a man to show emotion, especially not to sons he could make weak. It was part of a father&#x2019;s responsibility to be feared, though there were times when he ached to hug the boys and throw them up into the air. Knowing which horses they preferred showed his affection, and if they guessed at his feelings from a glance or a light in his eye, that was no more than his own father had done years before. He valued those memories in part for their rarity and could still recall the time his father had finally grunted approval at his knots and ropework with a heavy load. It was a small thing, but Yesugei thought of the old man whenever he yanked a rope tight, his knee hard into the bales. He watched his boys ride into the bright sunshine, and when they could no longer see him, his expression eased. His father had known the need for hard men in a hard land. Yesugei knew they would have to survive battle, thirst, and hunger if they were to reach manhood. Only one could be khan of the tribe. The others would either bend the knee or leave with just a wanderer&#x2019;s gift of goats and sheep. Yesugei shook his head at the thought, gazing after the dust trail of his sons&#x2019; ponies. The future loomed over them, while they saw only the spring and the green hills.<br><br>The sun was bright on his face as Temujin galloped. He reveled in the lift in spirit that came from a fast horse straining under him, the wind in his face. Ahead, he saw Bekter&#x2019;s gray mare recover from a stumble on a loose stone. His brother reacted with a sharp blow to the side of the mare&#x2019;s head, but they had lost a length and Temujin whooped as if he were about to ride past. It was not the right moment. He loved to lead, but he also enjoyed pressuring Bekter, because of the way it annoyed him.<br><br>Bekter was already almost the man he would be, with wide, muscular shoulders and immense stamina. His betrothal year with the Olkhun&#x2019;ut people had given him an aura of worldly knowledge he never failed to exploit. It irritated Temujin like a thorn under his skin, especially when his brothers pestered Bekter with questions about their mother&#x2019;s people and their customs. Temujin too wanted to know, but he decided grimly that he would wait to find out on his own, when Yesugei took him.<br><br>When a young warrior returned from his wife&#x2019;s tribe, he was given the status of a man for the first time. When the girl came into her blood, she would be sent after him with an honor guard to show her value. A ger would be ready for her and her young husband would wait at its door to take her inside.<br><br>For the Wolves, it was tradition for the young man to challenge his khan&#x2019;s bondsmen before he was fully accepted as a warrior. Bekter had been eager and Temujin remembered watching in awe as Bekter had walked up to the bondsmen&#x2019;s fire, close to Yesugei&#x2019;s ger. Bekter had nodded to them and three men had stood to see if his time with the Olkhun&#x2019;ut had weakened him. From the shadows, Temujin had watched, with Khasar and Kachiun silent at his side. Bekter had wrestled all three of the bondsmen, one after the other, taking terrible punishment without complaint. Eeluk had been the last, and the man was like a pony himself, a wall of flat muscle and wide arms. He had thrown Bekter so hard that blood had run from one of his ears, but then to Temujin&#x2019;s surprise, Eeluk had helped Bekter up and held a cup of hot black <i>airag </i>for him to drink. Bekter had almost choked at the bitter fluid mingling with his own blood, but the warriors had not seemed to mind.<br><br>Temujin had enjoyed witnessing his older brother beaten almost senseless, but he saw too that the men no longer scorned him around the fires at night. Bekter&#x2019;s courage had won him something intangible but important. As a result, he had become a stone in Temujin&#x2019;s path. As the brothers raced across the plains under a spring sun, there was no finishing line, as there would be at the great gathering of tribes. Even if there had been, it was too soon after winter to really push their mounts. They all knew better than to exhaust the ponies before they had ...</p><h2>Healing Remedies: Illustrated Encyclopedia</h2><p>The Alexander Technique is a unique system of mind and body awareness.

That&#x2019;s what happens when your mom is Zarela Martinez, one of the best Mexican cooks there is.</b> <br> <br> <b>I never forgot how powerful the flavors in the Mexican culinary arsenal are, the way just a few chipotles and a couple of garlic cloves could become something so good it could make you curse. And later in my life, the way a simple sauce could rocket my mind back to my mom&#x2019;s kitchen. When she&#x2019;d cook for me and my friends in New York, setting a bright green pumpkin seed sauce or sopes crowned with some mouth-searing salsa in front of us, they&#x2019;d ask, their eyes wide with excitement, &#x201c;Aar�n, what&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; <i>That</i>? I&#x2019;d think. <i>That&#x2019;s</i> love <i>right there</i>.</b> <br> <br> <b>When I was a kid, I&#x2019;d ask her to make <i>sopa seca</i>, a sort of Mexican-style pasta. She&#x2019;d fry alphabets so they&#x2019;d get all nutty, and simmer them with pureed roasted tomatoes and onions, cilantro, and a little chile. But she cooked more than just Mexican food. I remember these chicken wings with pineapple, soy, ginger, and scallions. Talk about delicious! I still can&#x2019;t make them quite like she does.</b> <br> <br>Whenever we visited El Paso, the border town where I was born, I was reminded how she got so damn good at cooking. I&#x2019;d get giddy before those trips, because it meant I&#x2019;d get to have my grandma&#x2019;s beans, which are pretty much the greatest food on earth&#x2014;well, aside from whatever else she made. When I got a little older, it dawned on me why it was all so delicious: she was never in a rush. Her beans would sit on the stove for what seemed like forever, getting tastier by the hour. Even after I&#x2019;d learned to cook more complicated food, I never forgot how with patience and a little know-how, even the simplest dishes could be spectacular.<br> <br>As a kid, I&#x2019;d gaze into her pot as she stirred a deep brown mole or stare at poblanos blackening over the blue flame on the stovetop. When I got a little older, I started to chip in. At first, I was relegated to chopping vegetables. Maybe I got to put together an hors d&#x2019;oeuvre. But I quickly graduated to toasting chiles, a simple but vital task. I caught on quickly&#x2014;when you&#x2019;re from a family of cooks, like a family of athletes, you realize that there are some things you can just <i>do,</i> without necessarily being taught.<br> <br>When I decided to work in kitchens, I wasn&#x2019;t after glory or fame. This was before the Age of the Celebrity Chef. All I knew was that I wanted to create the kind of joy that the women in my life created. But I knew I had to carve out my own path. So when I was still a teenager, I took off to New Orleans (where I swear I didn&#x2019;t see one Mexican) and started working for Paul Prudhomme, the chef who put the city on the national gastronomic map. I was thrilled by the food there, the delicious gumbo of Cajun, French, Italian, Creole, Native American, and Spanish influences that was as complex and satisfying as the best moles.<br> <br>Paul became my mentor. He taught me how to season food properly. He taught me to think, really <i>think</i>, about what goes on in your mouth when you taste food. He taught me the difference between blackening and burning. What is it? About three seconds.<br> <br>I went on to cook at Patria in New York for Douglas Rodriguez, another mentor who opened my eyes to ingredients and techniques that I&#x2019;d never seen before. That&#x2019;s where I met and fell in love with aji amarillo, the delicious chile from Peru, and learned to make <i>sofrito,</i> the incredibly flavorful slow-cooked vegetables that make Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Dominican food so damn good.<br> <br>The kitchen crew at Patria also taught me some life lessons. One night, I was doing my thing on the grill station. I was rocking it. Three hundred meals and zero complaints. I was pretty proud. I looked over at the sous-chef, Georgi, a guy I really respected, and said, &#x201c;Hey, how come every time I mess up, you guys chew my butt like chum, but tonight I didn&#x2019;t even get one compliment?&#x201d; He glared at me. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a popularity contest. When nobody says anything, that <i>is</i> a compliment.&#x201d;<br> <br>By the time I finally ran my own kitchen, I had so much to draw from, so many different chefs and eating experiences that had shaped my culinary style. The result was cooking that broke down borders, that brought together ingredients and techniques that made so much sense but had been kept apart out of habit.<br> <br>For this book, I decided to take all my incredible flavor memories and distill them into fifteen recipes, to cram all that flavor into magical sauces, purees, and pastes that you can keep in the fridge or freezer and pull out whenever you want to turn a simple collection of ingredients into a seriously tasty dinner. We&#x2019;re talking an easy but amazing spice rub, a practically effortless cilantro&#x2013;pumpkin seed pesto, an easy homemade dulce de leche, and much more. Each chapter begins with one of these, and what follows is a bunch of great recipes that apply it. Take my Garlic-Chipotle Love, for example, a puree of four easy-to-find ingredients that&#x2019;ll become your secret weapon in the battle for good food. I zoom in on certain techniques and ingredients to make sure you&#x2019;re successful, then I tell you how to store it and show you how once you&#x2019;ve made it, you&#x2019;re minutes away from mussels steamed with chipotle and beer; smoky, garlicky mashed potatoes; and hearty bean and butternut squash picadillo. I even show you all the ways it&#x2019;ll become a part of your everyday eating, whether you spread a little on your next burger or use it to spike your next salad dressing. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll come up with your own ideas as well. Then you&#x2019;ll have a &#x201c;whoa&#x201d; moment&#x2014;those fifteen recipes are your ticket to nearly one hundred dishes.<br> <br>Once you&#x2019;ve got an arsenal like this, your food will go from inspiring smiles and polite nods to igniting ridiculous grins and bear hugs.<br> <br>� 2011 Pl�cido</p><h2>Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism</h2><p>Drawing from rase histories, the author presents a comprehensive study of political propaganda methods used in China</p><p></p><h2>To Conquer Hell: The Meuse-Argonne, 1918 The Epic Battle That Ended the First World War</h2><p>The authoritative, dramatic, and previously untold story of the bloodiest battle in American history: the epic fight for the Meuse-Argonne in World War I<br>&nbsp;<br>On September 26, 1918, more than one million American soldiers prepared to assault the German-held Meuse-Argonne region of France. Their commander, General John J. Pershing, believed in the superiority of American "guts" over barbed wire, machine guns, massed artillery, and poison gas. In thirty-six hours, he said, the Doughboys would crack the German defenses and open the road to Berlin. Six weeks later, after savage fighting across swamps, forests, towns, and rugged hills, the battle finally ended with the signing of the armistice that concluded the First World War. The Meuse-Argonne had fallen, at the cost of more than 120,000 American casualties, including 26,000 dead. In the bloodiest battle the country had ever seen, an entire generation of young Americans had been transformed forever. <i>To Conquer Hell </i>is gripping in its accounts of combat, studded with portraits of remarkable soldiers like Pershing, Harry Truman, George Patton, and Alvin York, and authoritative in presenting the big picture. It is military history of the first rank and, incredibly, the first in-depth account of this fascinating and important battle.</p><p>Edward G. Lengel is an associate professor of history at the University of Virginia. He is the author of several books on military history, including <i>General George Washington: A Military Life</i>.

Clouds of dust swelled and drifted as infantry drilled and cavalry patrols came and went, and shouted orders echoed among the adobe walls. Through one dust cloud rode Lieutenant James L. Collins, the general&#x2019;s aide, who had set out from headquarters for a routine two-hour horseback tour around the base. Pershing would normally have accompanied him, but this morning he had decided to stay behind and get some paperwork done, so Collins took the tour alone. The lieutenant had got only halfway through his tour when Pershing&#x2019;s orderly galloped up and called him back to headquarters on urgent business.<br>Pershing had accompanied the 8th Brigade to Fort Bliss back in April, leaving behind his wife, Frankie, and their four children at the Presidio military base in San Francisco. The separation had been difficult, for John and Frankie loved each other dearly and also doted on their children&#x2014;three girls and a boy. Now, after four long months, his wife and children were finally about to follow him to Texas. Their departure from California was scheduled for August 28, and for the past several days the general had prepared eagerly for their arrival. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired of living alone,&#x201d; he confided to a friend. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m having my quarters fixed so that my wife and children can join me.&#x201d;1<br>When Collins arrived at headquarters, he found the usually confident, relaxed, and firmly in control general looking wide-eyed and desperate. &#x201c;My God, Collins,&#x201d; he gasped. &#x201c;Something terrible has happened at the Presidio! There&#x2019;s been a fire at the house!&#x201d;2<br>It took time for Collins to get the general to explain: less than an hour before, Pershing had been working at his desk when the telephone rang. He picked it up without identifying himself. The caller, an Associated Press correspondent named Norman Walker, said, &#x201c;Lieutenant Collins, I have some more news on the Presidio fire.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What fire?&#x201d; the general snapped. &#x201c;What has happened?&#x201d; Only then did the reporter realize that he had Pershing rather than his aide on the line. Horrified, Walker falteringly repeated a dispatch reporting that early that morning a fire had gutted Pershing&#x2019;s home at the Presidio. His wife and three of his children&#x2014;Helen, aged eight; Anne, aged seven; and Mary Margaret, aged three&#x2014;had perished of smoke inhalation. &#x201c;My God! My God! Can it be true?&#x201d; the general screamed. After a few moments in which the correspondent tried to offer his sympathy, Pershing&#x2019;s voice came back on the line, once more under control. &#x201c;Thank you, Walker,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It was very considerate of you to phone.&#x201d; Then he hung up.3<br>Two days later, the general&#x2019;s train pulled into the station at San Francisco. He had spent the last three hundred miles of the journey sobbing on a friend&#x2019;s shoulder, while Collins took charge of all his personal and official affairs. Pershing went immediately to the funeral parlor where the four caskets lay. Collins retired behind some drapes, but he could see the general kneeling in turn before each member of his family. About an hour later, Pershing asked to be taken to the ruins of his house. From there he went to the hospital where his five-year-old son, Warren, had stayed since his rescue. Pershing held the boy on his knee as they drove away from the hospital. Soon they passed the Fair Grounds, where in happier times the family had spent many a sunny afternoon. &#x201c;Have you been to the fair?&#x201d; the father managed to ask. &#x201c;Oh yes,&#x201d; the son innocently replied. &#x201c;Mama takes us a lot.&#x201d;<br>For the next weeks and months Pershing struggled to recover his self-control. At the funeral he stood with dignified poise, but his grief remained visible. He read each of the hundreds of letters of condolence, including one from his future enemy, the Mexican bandit Pancho Villa. He talked about the fire with friends, and tried to find some understanding and resignation. He sought solace in religion, and delved into staff paperwork with an intensity sometimes bordering on insanity. Occasionally, something made him break down, like an ill-timed comment, or the arrival of a trunk bearing his family&#x2019;s personal effects. In response to these moments he progressively walled himself in, retreating from the world, including acquaintances, friends, and what remained of his family. With Warren he shared a distant, embarrassed kind of affection.4 For the Pershing family, a long and happy fairy tale had come to a tragic end.&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in 1860 in Laclede, Missouri, one of nine children of a foreman on the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad, John J. Pershing had passed a happy but uneventful childhood. As a teenager he worked on his family&#x2019;s modest farm while teaching children at local country schools, including one for African Americans. Meanwhile he took classes at the Kirksville Normal School in preparation for a career as a teacher. After graduating in 1880, more on a whim than from any desire for a military career, Pershing took the entrance examination for the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. He passed by a single point, and enrolled. He achieved middling grades at the academy, but his natural aptitude as a soldier&#x2014;hitherto unguessed, for he did not come from a military family&#x2014;earned him the rank of senior cadet captain before his graduation in 1886.<br>Commissioned a second lieutenant in the 6th Cavalry and sent to the frontier, Pershing participated in the army&#x2019;s final campaign against Geronimo&#x2019;s Apaches in Arizona, and witnessed the Sioux Ghost Dance rebellion in South Dakota in 1891. Taking time out to earn a law degree from the University of Nebraska in 1893, he returned to field service in 1895 as an officer with the 10th Cavalry, a unit of black &#x201c;buffalo soldiers&#x201d; stationed in Montana. He returned to West Point as a tactical instructor in 1897, earning the sobriquet &#x201c;Black Jack&#x201d; because of his command of black troops. When the Spanish-American War began in 1898, he rejoined the 10th Cavalry as a captain and fought at San Juan Hill in Cuba alongside Theodore Roosevelt. Pershing next went to the Philippines, where he helped to put down an insurrection by the Moro Indians in 1903 before returning to the United States. An experienced and highly respected field and staff officer, he had also earned a reputation as a rake. Rivals accused him&#x2014;probably unjustly&#x2014;of fathering several illegitimate children with Filipino women.<br>Pershing&#x2019;s star continued to rise. Appointed to the army general staff in Washington, D.C., he befriended powerful men, including Senator Francis Emroy Warren of Wyoming, a snowy-haired Civil War veteran who had won the Medal of Honor in 1863. As chairman of the Senate&#x2019;s Military Affairs Committee, Warren wielded much influence in Congress. He was also the father of Helen Warren, an athletic and intelligent if not pretty twenty-four-year-old girl known to family and friends as Frankie. John and Frankie met, and promptly fell in love despite the twenty-year difference in their ages. Senator Warren approved the match, and after a joyous one-year courtship the couple married on January 26, 1905, in a ceremony attended by President Theodore Roosevelt. Over the next six years Frankie bore four children, three daughters and a son.<br>Shortly after their wedding the Pershings went to Japan, where he served as a military attach� and observed the Russo-Japanese War. They were celebrating the birth of their daughter Helen in Tokyo in September 1906 when word arrived that President Roosevelt had promoted John from captain to brigadier general over the heads of 862 more senior officers. Critics spoke of nepotism and derided him as the president&#x2019;s pet. The newly minted general silenced them quickly, justifying his promotion through first-rate administration and staff work.<br>In January 1914 Pershing took command of the 8th Infantry Brigade at the Presidio in San Francisco. There he and his family enjoyed an idyllic life, with Frankie active in the women&#x2019;s suffrage movement while her husband managed the brigade. The couple spent all of their free time together, and with their active and happy young children. Far away to the southeast, however, Mexico had descended into a state of anarchy, with political and social unrest spreading across the countryside and even over the border into Texas. To quell that unrest, Pershing and the 8th Brigade were ordered to Fort Bliss, near El Paso. Then the Presidio fire of August 1915 wrecked his family and tore the joy from his life.<br>Pershing continued to advance his career after the fire, but without enthusiasm. &#x201c;All the promotion in the world would make no difference now,&#x201d; he remarked after his promotion to major general in September 1916.5 Yet duty continued to call. Six months before his promotion, Pershing took command of a punitive expedition against Pancho Villa. The campaign, which lasted until January 1917, failed to achieve its objective. Villa escaped, and Pershing&#x2019;s force of twelve thousand troops returned to Texas empty-handed. But the expedition had seized the imagination of Americans, and for the first time in his life, &#x201c;Black Jack&#x201d; became a household name. Press correspondents trotted after him almost everywhere he went, shouting questions about politics and world affairs.<br>The reporters especially liked to quiz Pershing about the war in Europe. For the first two years after the war began in August 1914, it had been second- or third-page news. Firebrands like former president Theodore Roosevelt had exhorted the United States to intervene, and a few adventuresome volunteers&#x2014;like Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passos&#x2014;had gone to Europe as volunteer ambulance drivers, fliers, or soldiers. The vast majority of Americans, however, had no desire to become involved in another man&#x2019;s war. This remained true even after a German submarine sunk the British liner Lusitania in May 1915, killing 1,119 people, including 114 Americans. The sinking created deep popular resentment against Germany, but it did not spur any move for intervention, and in 1916 President Woodrow Wilson won reelection on a platform promising mothers that their children&#x2014;in the parlance of a popular song&#x2014;would not have to grow up to be soldiers.<br>In 1914&#x2013;15, Pershing had closely followed the fighting in Europe. He even hinted to his superiors that he would like to observe some of the battles.6 In the wake of the Presidio fire, however, he lost interest in European affairs, and the Mexican assignment took him mentally even further away from the trenches of France. He sympathized generally with the British and French in their struggle against Germany, and thought that American intervention might afford him a prospect of relief from the dusty wastes of southern Texas, but that was all. He felt no passion for heroism or the fight for justice against Teutonic baby killers. Nothing&#x2014;even the deaths of hundreds of thousands of men in battles like Verdun or the Somme&#x2014;moved him much anymore.<br>Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany shocked Americans out of their indifference on February 1, 1917, announcing that unrestricted submarine warfare, which had ceased after the Lusitania affair, would resume. All merchant vessels entering European waters, he declared, might be torpedoed without warning, whether or not they belonged to one of the belligerent nations. Wilson&#x2019;s government broke off diplomatic relations with Germany, but the submarines attacked anyway. Public outrage grew as ships sank and Americans died. The interception and publication of a telegram from Arthur Zimmermann, the German foreign minister, suggesting that Mexico might declare war on the United States in return for New Mexico, Arizona, and even Kansas, marked the last straw. With his entire cabinet and the American people outraged, the peace-loving Wilson reluctantly asked Congress for a declaration of war. The United States entered World War I on April 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pershing&#x2019;s call to duty came on May 3, in a telegram from Senator Warren in Washington, D.C. It read:<br>WIRE ME TODAY WHETHER AND HOW MUCH YOU SPEAK, READ AND WRITE FRENCH.<br>Pershing spoke French poorly, but he understood &#x201c;the possibilities to be implied from Senator Warren&#x2019;s telegram&#x201d;&#x2014;namely, military command. He replied:<br>SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS IN FRANCE 1908 STUDYING LANGUAGE. SPOKE QUITE FLUENTLY; COULD READ AND WRITE VERY WELL AT THAT TIME. CAN EASILY REACQUIRE SATISFACTORY WORKING KNOWLEDGE.<br>Soon another message arrived at Pershing&#x2019;s Texas headquarters, this time from Major General Hugh Lenox Scott, the army chief of staff. In code and marked &#x201c;for your eye alone,&#x201d; it announced that the War Department intended to send a small force to France in advance of the still-forming national army. &#x201c;If plans are carried out,&#x201d; Scott informed Pershing, &#x201c;you will be in command of the entire force.&#x201d; Interpreting this to mean that he would command a division, Pershing prepared for a summons to Washington. It came in short order.7<br>Pershing&#x2019;s train arrived in Washington on the bright and chilly morning of May 10. Newspaper reporters mobbed the general as he stepped onto the platform, asking whether his summons to the capital had anything to do &#x201c;with the election of a commander for a military expedition to France.&#x201d; Offering no comment, he stepped into a car that sped him to the War Department.8 Pershing first entered the army chief of staff&#x2019;s office. General Scott, a sixty-three-year-old former Indian fighter, had entered the famous 7th Cavalry just after the 1876 Battle of Little Big Horn. &#x201c;He was deaf,&#x201d; critics sneered, spoke in &#x201c;grunts and the sign language,&#x201d; and went to sleep in his chair while conducting official business.9 Pershing had little use for fossils and chafed at the chief of staff&#x2019;s unwillingness to get to specifics. Scott said that the government was considering sending a division of about twelve thousand men to France under Pershing&#x2019;s command. Later, a larger army would form. Just how large, nobody knew; nor did Scott explain where the soldiers would come from. Congress had just begun considering a military draft.<br>Leaving Scott&#x2019;s office little wiser than before, Pershing walked to the office of the secretary of war, Newton D. Baker. He found a thin, bespectacled man sitting behind a massive desk in an overstuffed office chair, reclining with one leg bent under his body and the other just barely reaching the floor. Baker neither looked nor acted the part of a secretary of war. As a boy, he had preferred books to tin soldiers and toy guns. As an adult, after becoming a solicitor and then mayor of Cleveland, he had rejected the honorary post as leader of Ohio&#x2019;s Boy Scouts because he considered the organization too militaristic. Woodrow Wilson named Baker secretary of war in 1916 because of his past political support for the Democratic Party, not because he had any qualifications for or particular interest in the office.10<br>Although they had little in common, Pershing liked the man. The secretary of war&#x2019;s mild exterior, he decided, masked a cultured, well-educated, and exceptionally gifted mind. Perhaps most important from Pershing&#x2019;s point of view, Baker believed in efficiency. &#x201c;He was courteous and pleasant,&#x201d; the general observed, &#x201c;and impressed me as being frank, fair, and business-like. His conception of the problems seemed broad and comprehensive. From the start he did not hesitate to make definite decisions on the momentous questions involved.&#x201d;11 As the war progressed the two would become unlikely, but firm, ...</p><h2>Gardens of Awe and Folly: A Traveler&#39;s Journal on the Meaning of Life and Gardening</h2><p><p>Nine masterpiece gardens.<br>Nine stories of grandeur, sorrow, disaster, triumph, discovery, and joy.<br>From Scotland to Key West, from Brazil to Paris--even right next door--there is always something to learn about being human from a great garden.</p></p><p>Vivian Swift is the author of <i>When Wanderers Cease to Roam: A Traveler's Journal of Staying Put</i> and <i>Le Road Trip: A Traveler's Journal of Love and France</i>.

Matlock, Jr., gives an eyewitness account of how the Cold War ended, with humankind declared the winner. As Reagan&#x2019;s principal adviser on Soviet and European affairs, and later as the U.S. ambassador to the U.S.S.R., Matlock lived history: He was the point person for Reagan&#x2019;s evolving policy of conciliation toward the Soviet Union. Working from his own papers, recent interviews with major figures, and archival sources both here and abroad, Matlock offers an insider&#x2019;s perspective on a diplomatic campaign far more sophisticated than previously thought, led by two men of surpassing vision. <br>Matlock details how, from the start of his term, Reagan privately pursued improved U.S.&#x2014;U.S.S.R. relations, while rebuilding America&#x2019;s military and fighting will in order to confront the Soviet Union while providing bargaining chips. When Gorbachev assumed leadership, however, Reagan and his advisers found a potential partner in the enterprise of peace. At first the two leaders sparred, agreeing on little. Gradually a form of trust emerged, with Gorbachev taking politically risky steps that bore long-term benefits, like the agreement to abolish intermediate-range nuclear missiles and the agreement to abolish intermediate-range nuclear missiles and the U.S.S.R.&#x2019;s significant unilateral troop reductions in 1988.<br><br>Through his recollections and unparalleled access to the best and latest sources, Matlock describes Reagan&#x2019;s and Gorbachev&#x2019;s initial views of each other. We learn how the two prepared for their meetings; we discover that Reagan occasionally wrote to Gorbachev in his own hand, both to personalize the correspondence and to prevent nit-picking by hard-liners in his administration. We also see how the two men were pushed closer together by the unlikeliest characters (Senator Ted Kennedy and Fran�ois Mitterrand among them) and by the two leaders&#x2019; remarkable foreign ministers, George Shultz and Eduard Shevardnadze.<br><br>The end of the Cold War is a key event in modern history, one that demanded bold individuals and decisive action.

After all, doesn&#x2019;t everyone know that President Reagan spent his first term bashing the Soviet Union and showed an interest in serious negotiations only in his second term? Such is the myth that has developed of late.<br><br>The dates are correct. All of the remarks quoted were made during the first eighteen months of Reagan&#x2019;s first administration. And they were not exceptional. These thoughts were present or clearly implied in virtually everything Reagan and his first secretary of state, Alexander Haig, said about relations with the Soviet Union from the outset of their terms in office.<br><br>Of course, these were not the only thoughts they expressed. Other statements, particularly when taken out of context, gave rise to the distorted impression that came to prevail in American and foreign opinion. Let us look carefully at what President Reagan said and how he said it.<br><br>During his first press conference as president, on January 29, 1981, Reagan stated that he was in favor of negotiating to achieve &#x201c;an actual reduction in the numbers of nuclear weapons&#x201d; on a basis that would be verifiable. He also declared that during any negotiation one had to take into account &#x201c;other things that are going on,&#x201d; and for that reason he believed in &#x201c;linkage.&#x201d;<br><br>A journalist asked what he thought of &#x201c;the long-range intentions of the Soviet Union&#x201d; and whether &#x201c;the Kremlin is bent on world domination that might lead to a continuation of the cold war&#x201d; or whether &#x201c;under other circumstances d�tente is possible.&#x201d; Addressing this convoluted question, Reagan replied that &#x201c;so far d�tente has been a one-way street that the Soviet Union has used to pursue its own aims,&#x201d; and that as far as Soviet intentions are concerned, their leaders have consistently said that &#x201c;their goal must be the promotion of world revolution and a one-world Socialist or Communist state.&#x201d;<br><br>Then he went on to add: &#x201c;Now, as long as they do that and as long as they, at the same time, have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is what will further their cause, meaning they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat, in order to attain that, and that is moral, not immoral, and we operate on a different set of standards, I think when you do business with them, even at a d�tente, you keep that in mind.&#x201d;<br><br>Press and television reporters repeated his words about lying and cheating as if they were the heart of his approach.* Only an extraordinarily attentive reader would have grasped that Reagan referred to lying and cheating not as a personal moral defect of the Soviet leaders but as a feature of the philosophy they held. When asked about the remark subsequently, he denied that he was &#x201c;castigating&#x201d; the Soviet leaders &#x201c;for lack of character,&#x201d; and explained, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that they don&#x2019;t think like we do.&#x201d;<br><br>In fact, Reagan cited in his first press conference several themes that remained in the bedrock of his policy toward the Soviet Union throughout his eight years in office: arms reduction to equal levels, as deep as the Soviet Union would accept; verification of agreements; linkage of arms control negotiations with Soviet behavior, in particular Soviet use of arms outside its borders; and reciprocity, inasmuch as the Soviet Union had taken advantage of the relaxed atmosphere of the 1970s (&#x201c;d�tente&#x201d;) to its own advantage. Additional themes and many details were added to his &#x201c;Soviet agenda&#x201d; over the next three years, but Reagan never altered his commitment to the goals he enunciated on January 29, 1981.<br><br>* For example, the New York Times headlined its report on the news conference &#x201c;President Reagan Assails Soviet Leaders for Reserving Right to &#x2018;Commit Any Crime, to Lie and Cheat.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br><b>A Different Policy<br></b><br>president reagan was convinced that the strategy the United States had followed previously in dealing with the Soviet Union had not been effective. He expressed that judgment repeatedly during his campaigns for the presidency. Once he took office he was determined to do things differently.<br><br>The approach he described in his first press conference represented significant departures from President Jimmy Carter&#x2019;s. In proposing an actual reduction in nuclear weapons, he was implicitly critical of the SALT II treaty that Carter had signed and the &#x201c;Vladivostok agreement&#x201d; concluded by President Gerald Ford, both of which would have placed limits on numbers of weapons without requiring a substantial reduction of existing arsenals. The condition that any agreement be verifiable was also intended to contrast Reagan&#x2019;s approach with Carter&#x2019;s, since Reagan and his supporters considered the verification provisions of SALT II inadequate.<br><br>Reagan&#x2019;s endorsement of linkage was also the opposite of Carter&#x2019;s policy, which had explicitly delinked arms control negotiations from other issues. Political reality had relinked the two, however, with the result that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was the final blow that prevented Senate ratification of SALT II.*<br><br>Reagan&#x2019;s goal was to shift the U.S. strategy from reacting to challenges and limiting damage to a concerted effort to change Soviet behavior. His approach constituted a direct challenge to the Soviet leadership since it explicitly denied fundamental tenets of Communist ideology and required a Soviet about-face on many issues under negotiation. It was a challenge to think differently about Soviet security, the place of the Soviet Union in the world, and the nature of Soviet society. It altered both the substance of negotiations and the way the dialogue was conducted, but it did not require the Soviet Union to compromise its own security. Soviet claims to the contrary, it never threatened military action against the Soviet Union itself.<br><br>* When the SALT II treaty was before the U.S. Senate for ratification in 1979, I was a strong and vocal supporter of it. My support was not solely because, as a foreign service officer on active duty, I was obligated to support the president&#x2019;s policy. I also judged that SALT II was the best that could be achieved at that time and that it could act as a brake on the arms race and open the door to significant reductions in the future. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 changed my mind. It proved to me that the Soviet leaders were more interested in using force for geopolitical gain than in reducing arms, which ultimately would have made any arms limitation agreement a source of contention rather than a step toward ending the arms race. Furthermore, the reaction of the Senate and the American public demonstrated that separating the arms reduction process from other issues was not politically tenable in the United States.<br><br>During his first two years in office, Reagan explained his policies to the <br><br>public piecemeal and not always with coherence, but there was an inner consistency: to deter further aggressive behavior by the Soviet Union, to make sure the Soviet leaders could never have the illusion that they could win a war with the United States, and, having ensured against that, to prepare the United States for successful negotiations. He had no secret strategy, but described every element of his policy to the public.<br><br>Hindsight allows us to group Reagan&#x2019;s early policies toward the Soviet Union in a few major tendencies, interrelated but distinct: telling the truth about the Soviet Union, restoring U.S. and allied strength, deterring aggression, and establishing reciprocity.<br><br>Setting the Record Straight<br><br>reagan was convinced that U.S. presidents had normally refrained from frank criticism of the Soviet Union when they tried to cooperate with it. During World War II he had seen how Hollywood, with encouragement from Washington, had created a picture of a benign &#x201c;Uncle Joe&#x201d; Stalin, a personally modest man dedicated to bringing about democracy and social justice to his backward country. In the interest of making Americans feel good about their Soviet ally, moviemakers of the day flagrantly distorted history, as in the film version of Joseph Davies&#x2019;s Mission to Moscow, which portrays the innocent victims of Stalin&#x2019;s purge trials as traitors, justly accused of treason.<br><br>Wouldn&#x2019;t it have been better, Reagan asked, if Franklin Roosevelt had been more candid about the nature of the alliance with the Soviet Union? It really had nothing to do with whether the Soviet Union was a democracy or not, but whether cooperation was essential to defeat Hitler. It was, and it could be justified on that basis, without arousing extravagant expectations about the prospects for close postwar collaboration.<br><br>Later, other presidents had seemed to ignore the nature of the Soviet system whenever there was an effort to expand cooperation and control the arms race. Too often, he felt, this practice resulted in one-sided agreements that the Soviets exploited to their advantage. Even when balanced agreements were reached, the public was led to expect too much from them, and this could lead to overreaction if expectations were not met. Take the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan: didn&#x2019;t Carter&#x2019;s zeal to get the SALT II agreement ratified cause him to ignore the signs th...</p><h2>Basic Colored Pencil Techniques (Basic Techniques)</h2><p>Offers detailed advice on working with colored pencils, describes shortcuts and techniques for handling backgrounds, and explains how to adapt other media</p><p>Borgeson, author of several books on the subject, is recognized as having helped renew interest in colored pencil as a fine medium. This volume is a revision of her earlier Colored Pencil Fast Techniques (Watston-Guptill, 1988). It fits well in the "Basic Techniques" series, with individual sections on tools, drawing surfaces, etc., giving way to discussions of sophisticated techniques of layering, burnishing, and lifting color. An excellent chapter of studio tips is added. Warr's work strives to be comprehensive but fails for lack of space, and its scattershot style will confuse the beginner for whom it was written.

On that day, his family's car skidded off an overpass, killing Matt's father and sister and left him paralyzed from the chest down, confining him to a wheelchair. His mother and brother escaped from the accident unharmed but were left to pick up the pieces of their decimated family.</p><p>This pivotal event set Matt off on a lifelong journey, from his intensive care experiences at the Mayo Clinic to becoming a paralyzed yoga teacher and founder of a non-profit organization.

I do not mean this metaphorically. I literally mean that my mouth does not seem to possess the ability to form a frown, like a tongue that cannot curl. Instead, the outer corners of my mouth turn slightly upward, making my default expression a smile. After all that has happened, I am grateful for this fact.<br><br>This does not mean that I am particularly upbeat or light-hearted. In fact, my wife, Jennifer, complains that I am unrelentingly serious, especially in the descending moments before sleep. It is then that Jennifer knows to stop reading and extinguish her light. Her eyes close as she utters the words "It's time to lay down, lover."<br><br>It is early morning, and I am lying in bed. I am entering the summer that approaches my thirty-ninth birthday. I still have those boyish jolly cheeks, curly light brown hair, and a short beard that is beginning to show hints of gray. In a few hours, I will be<br><br>teaching my Monday, 9:30 yoga class. As usual, I am not sure what I will teach, but I am hoping for inspiration, a sudden burst of how a particular yoga pose feels. I am looking for a feeling that can bridge the gap between my own paralyzed body and the walking bodies of my students.<br><br>Sitting up without disturbing Jennifer's sleep is difficult. I grab the edge of the bed and pull myself over to my right side. As I do, my gaze encounters my wheelchair, like it has for more than a quarter of a century. Even after all this time, I am often surprised to see it sitting quietly at my bedside, waiting not for someone else but for me. In one continuous movement, I swing my legs off the bed and rise to a sitting position. After twenty-five years of paralysis and thirteen years of yoga, my muscles below my chest remain unresponsive to my direct command. I put one hand on the seat of my wheelchair, one hand firmly on the bed, and lift myself onto the main source of my mobility.<br><br>I am up early this morning to practice pranayama, the yogic art of breathing. I want to finish before my house wakes, before Jennifer's coffeemaker begins to groan, before my son's feet begin to travel across our wooden floors. As I wheel silently down the hallway, I do not feel my feet against my foot pedals, but I do feel a buzz, a hum that travels throughout my entire body, both my paralyzed and unparalyzed body. I gently lower myself down onto our living room rug. It is a transfer that has taken years to perfect--to move as a unified whole, to combine flexing arms and flaccid legs into a single flowing movement.<br><br>The morning sunlight beams through our east-facing windows and creeps across my body. I am lying on two accordion-folded blankets that run along the length of my spine. A third blanket is folded to form a makeshift pillow under my head. This posture begins my practice. Its effect is a delicate balance that opens and lifts my chest, while also lengthening the back of my neck. It is designed to allow my breath to enter my chest and torso more freely.<br><br>The bustle of life has begun around me. I hear the bathroom door latch and water pour from the faucet. In these last few yogic breaths, I can feel that my diaphragm is slightly gripped--it is the anticipation of contact with others. I sink inward and feel presence in the backs of my heels. The effect is a softening of my diaphragm.<br><br>I marvel with a thought. After all that I have been through, the ability to connect awareness through my heels represents one of my greatest accomplishments--something so subtle, something that seems so ordinary. I am not walking, nor do I feel courageous, but I have worked hard for such a moment. It has taken patience, persistence, and a willingness to feel vulnerable. It has taken a different kind of strength.<br><br>I hear the sound of feet tramping down the hallway. I feel Paul peering down at me. "Why are you sleeping on the floor, Papa?"

In "The Gilgul of Park Avenue," a Protestant has a religious awakening in the back of a New York taxi. In the collection's hilarious title story, a Hasidic man incensed by his wife's interminable menstrual cycle gets a dispensation from his rabbi to see a prostitute.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The stories in <b>For the Relief of Unbearable Urges</b> are powerfully inventive and often haunting, steeped in the weight of Jewish history and in the customs of Orthodox life. But it is in the largeness of their spirit-- a spirit that finds in doubt a doorway to faith, that sees in despair a chance for the heart to deepen--and in the wisdom that so prodigiously transcends the author's twenty-eight years, that these stories are truly remarkable. Nathan Englander envisions a group of Polish Jews herded toward a train bound for Auschwitz and in a deft imaginative twist turns them into acrobats tumbling out of harm's way; he takes an elderly wigmaker and makes her, for a single moment, beautiful. Again and again, Englander does what feels impossible: he finds, wherever he looks, a province beyond death's dominion.<br><br><b>For the Relief of Unbearable Urges</b> is a work of stunning authority and imagination--a book that is <br>as wondrous and joyful as it is wrenchingly sad, and that heralds the arrival of a profoundly gifted new <br>storyteller.</p><p><i>For the Relief of Unbearable Urges</i> is an astonishment. Whether Nathan Englander is creating the last days of 27 condemned Soviet writers or the first in which a Park Avenue lawyer finds religion (in a taxi, no less), his gift is everywhere in evidence. Englander's specialty is the collision of Jewish law and tradition with secular realities, whether in Brooklyn, Tel Aviv, or Stalinist Russia. In one tale, a wigmaker from an ultra-orthodox Brooklyn enclave journeys into Manhattan for supplies and, more importantly, inspiration--frequenting a newsstand where she pays for the right to flip through forbidden fashion magazines. If all Ruchama wants to do is be beautiful again and momentarily free of communal constraints, others ask only to survive. In "The Tumblers," set in World War II Poland (with a metafictional twist), followers of the Mahmir Rebbe get into a train filled with circus performers rather than into a cattle car. Their only chance is to camouflage themselves as part of the troupe: <blockquote> Their acceptance as acrobats was a stretch, a first-glance guess, a benefit of the doubt granted by circumstance and only as valuable as their debut would prove. It was an absurd undertaking. But then again, Mendel thought, no more unbelievable than the reality from which they'd escaped, no more unfathomable than the magic of disappearing Jews. </blockquote> Another story, "Reb Kringle," is almost breezy by comparison. Each year, one Brooklynite dreads his holiday job from hell, playing Santa Claus in a Manhattan department store: "There were elves posted on each side of Itzik; one--a humorless, muscular midget--wore a pair of combat boots that gave him the look of elf-at-arms. His companion might have been a twin. He wore black high-tops but had the same vigilant paramilitary demeanor." Itzik can put up with the children's accidents and greed, with his sciatica, and even with a mischief maker's attempt to cut off his beard. But when one boy admits that what he really wants to do is celebrate Hanukkah, "the infamous Reb Santa" loses it. Though this is undoubtedly the collection's lightest piece--proof positive that you have to be a saint to be a Jewish Santa--it is no less piercing an examination of identity and obligation than Englander's more heavyweight entries. <i>--Kerry Fried</i>"A debut collection of nine stories that explore the condition of being Jewish, with an often hallucinatory, epigrammatic eloquence that is, as advertised, reminiscent of the fiction of Issac Singer, Saul Bellow, and especially Bernard Malamud.

"We believe we are measured by how well, or how little, we manifest virtue in our life's journey," writes Joseph Marshall, himself a Lakota. This collection of stories illustrates how generations are taught the Lakota Way of virtuous living through oral storytelling. Marshall recounts the tale of Deer Woman--a siren that lures hunters to her teepee then steals their souls. As the story goes, a grandmother warns her grandson not to be trapped by this beautiful soul-snatcher. When the grandson finally encounters Deer Woman, he is able to resist her seduction, not because he is afraid she'll steal his soul, but because he would never disobey his grandmother. For the Lakota, respect for elders is one of the most honored virtues. After each story, Marshall offers a gracefully rendered essay on the virtue it espouses and how it's applied to daily life. We are fortunate that Marshall translated these precious stories into written English. "They are our gift to the world," he explains. "They are not guarded secrets, they are markers on the road to life--the answers soaring across the open prairies of our lives on the winds of wisdom--helping us, perhaps helping you." <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Joseph Marshall was born on the Rosebud Reservation in south central South Dakota.

We shall climb to the highest peaks and there the magnificent view of all of life shall be our reward.<br><br> I always say that my mother gave me birth and my mother gave me rebirth. On the first occasion she gave me physical life. On the second, when I was nineteen, she opened my mind to the world beyond the physical-an experience that led to a transformative understanding of why I'd often felt anxious and uncertain growing up, unable to plunge into life without a deeper comprehension of its meaning. That encounter set me on the path to meeting the spiritual guides and teachers who have since become the most powerful influences in my life, offering me tools and insights through which to navigate both the ordinary and extraordinary challenges of daily living.<br><br> Let me explain.<br><br> As a child, I had experiences that no one else around me seemed to share. At night, I saw faces in the dark, and although my father tried to reassure me that they were merely the work of a vivid imagination, I begged him to let me sleep with my light on. Sometimes I had out-of-body experiences: I'd be lying on my bed, when suddenly the room would start to spin, and "I" was on the ceiling looking down at "my" body still on the bed. How can this be? I wondered. Am I the body on the bed, or am I on the ceiling? Who am I?<br><br> Sometimes I saw light around people. I told my father, a physicist, "Daddy, I can see molecules!"-a word I'd learned from him. He replied that no one can see molecules with the naked eye, and to prove his point he brought me to an electron microscope laboratory at Yale University, where he was on sabbatical, to show me what molecules really looked like. As I watched the microscope screen I understood that he was right, of course. But if I wasn't seeing molecules, what was I seeing? Not knowing scared me.<br><br> Other times, I was overwhelmed by so many feelings and impressions that I couldn't even begin to sort them out, much less interpret them. In fifth grade, I remember missing an entire math lesson because I was so absorbed by the images and insights I was picking up about my teacher's personal life. I was also distracted by the fascinating nature of this ability.<br><br> I questioned my friends and other family members to see if they had similar experiences. They thought I was making up stories, so I learned to keep quiet about my unusual episodes. Although I spent a great deal of time feeling misunderstood and confused (spending time alone in nature was one of my few solaces), I always felt loved by my family. But as time passed I grew increasingly anxious.<br><br> This anxiety was rooted in some ways in a terrible shock that hit my family when I was very young. At the age of thirty-two, my mother woke one morning to discover that she was blind, the first sign of what would eventually be diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. The disease progressed rapidly, affecting both her mind and her body. If my mother was sick, I thought, perhaps I was, too.<br><br> Over the years, as I watched her deteriorate mentally and physically, I wanted to understand why my mother, who was a good person and loved us all so much, suffered so. I asked many such "why" questions, but no one provided me with satisfactory answers. Though I was raised without religion and felt agnostic, I took a tour of churches in our area when I was around ten or eleven, to see if religion could offer any resolution. I didn't find a source of information that felt personal or persuasive, nor did there seem to be much tolerance for my most pressing questions.<br><br> When I was seventeen, my mother died, paralyzed and unable to talk. The following year, I went to college, where I hoped to find a better understanding of life's meaning in books and classes on psychology and philosophy. I wanted to believe what I heard in lectures and seminars and embrace the concepts in books I was assigned, but I didn't feel certainty or confidence in the material presented. My life would have been easier if I had, but I didn't know if the ideas were actually true.<br><br> I frequently wrote in journals, continuing to ask myself questions and searching for peace of mind. After my first year in college, I decided to take a leave of absence and travel. Privately, I resolved that during that year of exploration I would find my life's purpose. A friend told me about having had mystical experiences in Cuernavaca, Mexico, so I decided to go there. I was ready to be open to whatever came my way.<br><br> Spiritual Awakening<br><br> Before arranging for my leave of absence, I visited one of my brothers, who lived and worked in New York City. At that time, he was dating a woman named Catherine, who called herself a trance medium-which I thought was very odd. Although I did have something of a mystical streak, and had wrestled with questions about the meaning and purpose of life, mediums and clairvoyants didn't really fit into my scheme of things. I'd certainly never met one in person.<br><br> A few moments after my brother introduced us, Catherine asked me, "Is there anyone who is dead that you'd like to speak with?"<br><br> Her blunt question startled me, but I managed to reply, "I don't know if I believe in life after death. But if I can, I'd like to speak with my mother."<br><br> Catherine didn't know about my mother, as she hadn't been dating my brother for very long; because my brother was rather reserved about emotional issues, he hadn't said much about our painful family situation. I didn't tell her, either, because at that point anything to do with my mother had been banished to a private, locked-up room of my psyche-one tinged with the misplaced guilt of a sensitive child with a very ill and suffering parent.<br><br> That evening, Catherine invited me into her apartment, just two floors below my brother's in the same building on Thompson Street. As she sat down to meditate, I waited and watched as her cats literally jumped off the walls and ran into the bathroom, apparently reacting to something I couldn't see. Many emotions and childhood memories swirled inside me as Catherine went into a trance. My mother had entered a nursing home when I was only eight years old, and as the years passed she became less and less a presence in my life; in many ways I hardly knew her. Then all of a sudden Catherine was lying down, in what looked to me like a paralyzed state, and to my surprise, I saw my mother's face superimposed over hers. The difference in their appearance was unmistakable. Catherine was blond and had a wide, round Slavic-looking face; my mother had a narrower face with high cheekbones and dark brown hair mixed with gray.<br><br> Then with great effort, my mother spoke to me. I had to bend over Catherine to hear, but it was my mother's voice, without a doubt.<br><br> "Do not mourn for me," she said, "for I chose what I endured." She then went on to say that no matter how things appear on the surface, "if you look deep enough, you will see there are always reasons and justice."<br><br> She told me she forgave me for all the things I'd done that were not quite right, because I'd only been a child-a statement that immediately released an enormous sense of guilt I'd unknowingly been carrying. She spoke to me about the process of reincarnation and told me that in previous lives she'd been selfish and arrogant. (Many years later, I had visions of my mother in a former life in ancient Rome, where she'd been an aristocrat with significant power, and had ignored the suffering of many people around her.) During her incarnation as my mother, she continued, she'd learned through her own suffering that we are all connected, and that if we ignore the struggles of others, we ignore our own. That was the justice to be found in the suffering she endured in her most recent life: She'd acquired the capacity to experience and express genuine compassion.<br><br> For me, her statement, If you look deep enough, there are always reasons and justice, was a revelation. It meant that life had order; it wasn't just chaos and cruelty, as it had often appeared to me. Faced so immediately and intimately with reincarnation-and the opportunity for learning that comes with it-I found that life all at once began to make sense. There were reasons why things transpired as they did. I began to feel more pleasure in being alive.<br><br> Communicating with my mother on a spiritual plane also brought into sharp and dramatic focus the sensitivity I'd experienced since childhood. After that session, Catherine went upstairs to spend the night with my brother, while I stayed in her apartment. But I realized I wasn't alone: Entities and spirits could be all around me, and know my thoughts. For the first time, I grasped that no aspect of my life was completely private. Initially that awareness felt frightening and embarrassing, though now it feels comforting to be completely seen and never feel alone.<br><br> Unable to sleep that night, I read a book on palmistry I found on Catherine's bookshelf. The next day, I was amazed to discover that when I looked at people's palms, I could see visions of their soul's journey-an ability, I later learned, known as "hand scrying." On the bus back to college, I sat next to a woman who was obviously troubled. I plunged ahead. "Let me look at your hand," I asked her. She agreed, and I saw visions that enabled me to tell her about her life.<br><br> I continued to have more such clairvoyant experiences, which further opened me to phenomena I hadn't previously been conscious of or that once had frightened me. As I recalled my childhood episodes, I was able to look at them from the new perspective that my mother had brought to me.<br><br> I was certainly a spiritual novice at that point, beginning to be aware of my abilities, yet untrained in how to integrate them into my life. Not long after my first experience with Catherine (she and my brother had broken up by then but we were still friends), we visited an artist who had a collection of sculptures in his large and luxurious apartment. As the afternoon wore on the three of us found ourselves having a wide-ranging and amiable conversation. Suddenly, though, I found myself able to feel the unhappiness of this man who appeared to be surrounded by ease and privilege. Despite his talent, success, wealth, and apparent comfort he seemed lonely, embittered, and lost. Thinking it might help him, I began to talk about the experiences I'd had with my mother. I mentioned how much grief and guilt I'd suffered during her illness and death, and how that burden had lifted. I ventured further, telling him what I had begun to see and understand, and what I saw about his life.<br><br> To my surprise, he wasn't at all interested to hear what I had to say; in fact, he was quite hostile. "Who do you think you are, the Chosen One?" he asked. "You've been put on earth to tell people what their problems are, and what gives you the right to do that?"<br><br> I turned to Catherine, hoping for rescue, but she was as confused as I, and eventually we made as graceful an exit as possible. I went home that evening troubled. Did I think I was special, "chosen," put on earth to impart truths that others would rather not acknowledge? The idea seemed distasteful, arrogant. It hadn't been my intention to show off my specialness, but instead to offer something that could be useful. Clearly, I didn't know how.<br><br> Surprising Encounters<br><br> Not long afterward, I went to Cuernavaca as I'd originally planned and attended a school started by Ivan Illich, a former Roman Catholic priest who promoted the idea that education isn't confined solely to formal classrooms and structured class periods; rather, life itself is a school. I stayed in an old mansion on a beautiful estate, which I shared with an interesting group of people from around the world who were drawn to Illich's idea of "de-schooling" society.<br><br> While in Cuernavaca, I spent many afternoons at an English-language bookstore. At that time, I gravitated toward books that discussed spiritual topics, most of which advocated meditation, and after asking around a bit, I located a place that taught yoga and meditation. I attended only one class, but it was a fascinating and unusual experience, because the teacher and all the students in the class spoke Spanish, a language I didn't know. Very carefully, I observed everyone and followed along. The first part of the class was devoted to practicing yoga postures; then the men headed into the men's locker room and the women into the women's locker room to take showers. I shadowed a friendly older woman who spoke some broken English, and while we were getting dressed she explained that we must be clean and fresh before meditation.<br><br> After we all returned to the large open space, everyone sat in lotus position and closed their eyes to meditate. The teacher gave what I assumed was some formal instruction, which I couldn't understand. I relied on my memory of what I had read about meditation-simply that meditation is an inner stillness, a holding one's thoughts at bay, so that was what I did. I discovered that I was a natural meditator. I was able to keep my mind still for long periods without much effort, just as I had as a child, when, for instance, I'd stare out a window with my mind free of thoughts. After that one afternoon, I started to sit in stillness as a regular practice.<br><br> One day at the English-language bookstore, I met an American man, an actor who was interested in making a film based on a book called A World Beyond, by a then-famous medium named Ruth Montgomery. Montgomery was living in Cuernavaca at the time, and after this man explained who he was and showed me some newspaper clippings to verify that he had been on Broadway, he asked if I knew her. I didn't, but without thinking, I told him that as a child I'd had experiences leaving my body, and if we could find a quiet place to meditate, I thought I could do so again and locate her. I have no idea what possessed me to tell him that; I suppose I felt cocky and confident.</p><h2>Winston S. Churchill THE SECOND WORLD WAR</h2><p>First published in 2003.

Even though vast numbers of them suffer in this oppressively hierarchical system, and even though it appears to be plunging them toward a global catastrophe, they cling to it as if it were the most wonderful thing (as they quaintly say) since sliced bread. That a more agreeable (and less catastrophic) system exists BEYOND civilization, seems to be entirely unthinkable to them.<br><br>In <b>Beyond Civilization</b>, Daniel Quinn has made it his task to think the unthinkable. We all know there's no one right way to build a bicycle, no one right way to design an automobile, no one right way to construct a pair of shoes, but we're convinced there must be only one right way for people to live--and the one we have is it, no matter what. Even if we hate it, we must cling to it. Even if it drags us to the brink of extinction, we must not let it go.<br><br>Many other peoples have built civilizations--and then walked away from them. Quinn examines the Maya, the Olmec, the people of Teotihuac�n, and others, who did just that. But they all walked away moving backward--to an earlier lifestyle. Quinn's goal in this book is to show how we can walk away moving forward, to a new lifestyle, one which encourages diversity instead of suppressing it. Not a "New World Order," but rather a New Personal Order. Not legislative change at the governmental level, but rather incremental change at the human level.<br><br>This is a guidebook for people who want to assert control over their destiny and recover the freedom to live at a scale and in a style of their own choosing--and starting now, today, not in some distant utopian future.</p><p>Futurist Daniel Quinn (<i>Ishmael</i>) dares to imagine a new approach to saving the world that involves deconstructing civilization. Quinn asks the radical yet fundamental questions about humanity such as, Why does civilization grow food, lock it up, and then make people earn money to buy it back? Why not progress "beyond civilization" and abandon the hierarchical lifestyles that cause many of our social problems? He challenges the "old mind" thinking that believes problems should be fixed with social programs. "Old minds think: How do we stop these bad things from happening?" Quinn writes. "New minds think: How do we make things the way we want them to be?"<p> Whether he is discussing Amish farming, homelessness, "tribal business," or holy work, Quinn's manifesto is highly digestible. Instead of writing dense, weighty chapters filled with self-important prose, he's assembled a series of brief one-page essays. His language is down to earth, his metaphors easy to grasp. As a result, readers can read about and ponder <i>Beyond Civilization</i> at a blissfully civilized pace. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>"Beyond Civilization is the most solid, real, practical, and you-can-really-do-it book you'll ever find on how to save the world. Daniel Quinn has again proven he is one of our century's greatest and most insightful thinkers.

Living in San Francisco with her widowed mother, Phoebe drifts along the edges of her life, obsessed by the memory of her charismatic older sister, Faith, a true flower child who died mysteriously in Italy eight years before. Believing that her sister's fatal journey holds the key to her own transformation, Phoebe bolts to Europe.<br>Phoebe follows the itinerary Faith had spelled out in postcards home - London, Amsterdam, Paris - but the millennial excitement of Faith's Europe has vanished, and Phoebe finds herself vulnerable and isolated. Finally she reaches Italy and traces her sister's last steps. But the truth Phoebe discovers is darker and more complicated than anything she has imagined, and finally she must face the human price her sister paid for taking her quest for personal liberation to the very edge.<br>Only by dispelling the ghosts of a romanticized past does Phoebe come into full possession of her world. Jennifer Egan portrays this fundamental passage with a mastery of riveting narrative extraordinary in a first novel. As it confronts the ambiguous legacy of the sixties, The Invisible Circus also beautifully and powerfully describes a journey essential to all of us.</p><p>The hope and heartbreak of the Sixties still linger in America's consciousness. In this breathtaking debut, Jennifer Egan brings to life the seductive pull of that era as it exerts itself on two sisters, separated by a decade, who take enormous risks to personify its ideals. It is 1978. Phoebe O'Connor, 18, runs off to Europe seeking answers about the tragedy that has haunted her family for eight years: the sudden dead of her older sister Faith while in Italy. To Phoebe, Faith epitomizes the youthful, chaotic freedom of the Sixties, and imitating her becomes Phoebe's way of trying to elevate herself from a life that seems drab and unsatisfying compared to the vivid spectacle that was Faith's. Once in Europe, Phoebe follows the itinerary Faith spelled out in postcards from her fatal trip, landing in London, living in a hostel in Amsterdam, taking a tab of LSD in Paris. But instead of the millennial excitement that Faith had sensed in 1960s Europe, Phoebe encounters disappointment and ennui. And when Faith's old lover joins Phoebe to retrace those last days in Italy, Phoebe glimpses the human price that her sister paid in following her uncompromising quest for personal liberation. With its coolly graceful prose and mastery of narrative, <i>The Invisible Circus</i> is an unforgettable first novel by a writer of uncommon ability.Jennifer Egan was born in Chicago and grew up in San Francisco.

When she arrives Downeast, Cass stumbles across a decades-old mystery that is still claiming victims, and into one final shot at redemption. </p> <p> <strong>Questions for Elizabeth Hand</strong> </p><p> <strong>Jeff VanderMeer for Amazon.com:</strong> Your novel <i>Generation Loss</i> introduces readers to a very eccentric and sometimes selfish photographer named Cass. Are all artists inherently selfish? </p><p> <strong>Hand:</strong> Yes. You can't be an artist without being inherently self-involved, without believing that the world owes you a living, and that everything you do--anything, matter how sick or twisted or feeble or pathetic--is worthy of attention. This is the secret behind the success of stuff like <i>American Idol</i> and YouTube. This is the world Andy Warhol bequeathed to us. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Isn't it partially that selfishness that results in great fiction? Isn't the antagonist of your novel in a way driven by selfishness? </p><p> <strong>Hand:</strong> I don't think I'd call it selfishness, to be truthful. I think creating any real art depends on an intense amount of focus�--of filtering out the rest of the world as much as you can, to sustain and then impart your own vision or secondary world--what John Gardner called "the vivid and continuous dream." I think the antagonist of <i>Generation Loss</i> sees himself as being impelled by love--romantic love, carnal love, the pure love of artistic creation--not selfishness. Whereas Cass's motivation is something far darker and more sinister than love. She's seen the abyss; she lives there. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Is Cass Neary a prototypical "bad girl"? </p><p> <strong>Hand:</strong> Well, she's your prototypical amoral speedfreak crankhead kleptomaniac murderous rage-filled alcoholic bisexual heavily-tattooed American female photographer. So, yeah. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> So this is definitely not what you'd call "chick lit"? </p><p> <strong>Hand:</strong> Umm, probably not. If it were a movie, it would have a NC-17 rating. Or maybe NR. Is <i>Lolita</i> considered chick lit? That book had a huge influence on me, especially with this novel. I always wanted to create a narrator like Humbert Humbert, someone utterly reprehensible and unsympathetic who still manages to command a reader's attention and even an uneasy sympathy. I loved the idea of making a reader complicit with the crimes committed by a protagonist. The simple act of continuing to turn the pages makes you guilty by association. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Did you have a particular artist in mind as the inspiration for the foul-smelling but visionary paintings in the novel? </p><p> <strong>Hand:</strong> No. That part I made up. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> C'mon. You're not allowed to just make things up. Spill the beans. </p><p> <strong>Hand:</strong> No, I really didn't have anyone in mind. There are elements of the work of photographers I admire--Robert Mapplethorpe, Cindy Sherman, Sally Man, Joel-Peter Witkin--and of outsider artists like Henry Darger or Richard Dadd or Roky Erickson. But the whole concept of an artist creating his own emulsion paper--I thought of that, then researched it and learned that, indeed, some photographers work that way. I also consulted a photographic conservator who's an acquaintance and asked him, Is this possible? He said yes, and I took it from there. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Are people in Maine as mean toward tourists as you describe? </p><p> <strong>Hand:</strong> No. Just me. Though folks who work at the general store three doors down from me really do sometimes wear a T-shirt that reads THEY CALL IT TOURIST SEASON, WHY CAN'T WE SHOOT THEM? So, okay, me and them. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Have you ever driven a tourist off your property with a shovel? </p><p> <strong>Hand:</strong> Not yet. But I would. A few years ago friend said he pictured me up on the Laurentian shield, threatening outsiders with a pitchfork. That's pretty accurate. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Weren't you once a tourist? </p><p> <strong>Hand:</strong> Never. I lived in DC for 13 years, and worked for a long time at the Smithsonian's National Air &amp; Space Museum--Tourist Central. That effectively killed any sympathy I might ever have had towards them. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What's coming up for you? </p><p> <strong>Hand:</strong> Well, I'll be doing some touring and readings for this book, and I hope to record the entire novel as a podcast/audio book--I'm very excited to be performing again. I'm presently at work on a YA novel about Arthur Rimbaud called <i>Wonderwall</i>, to be published by Viking, and am brooding on another novel that might be something along the lines of <i>Generation Loss</i>, or not. I get restless and like to shift gears a lot.

Oz and Roizen&#x2014;the bestselling coauthors of the blockbuster <i>YOU </i>series&#x2014;present a new edition of their #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling indispensable guide to maintaining vibrant health, improving longevity, and aging gracefully.<br><br>Most people think that by age forty-five, every aspect of our bodies is bound to decline. But the wear and tear associated with aging is not inevitable. In fact, the biological processes that age you can be reprogrammed to work the same way they did when you were younger. In this revised edition of the bestselling classic, Drs. Oz and Roizen show you how to beat the seemingly inevitable aging process.<br> <br>With their entertaining style and signature insight, Dr. Oz and Roizen share a new introduction on telomeres, the nucleotide sequences that cap your chromosomes and may the hold the key to determining your lifespan. There are steps we can take to protect and lengthen these sequences, and <i>YOU: Staying Young</i> explains what to do.<br> <br>Grounded in the latest scientific research and filled with illustrations, Dr. Oz and Roizen&#x2019;s fourteen-day plan for staying young will help readers boost vitality, increase energy, and improve vitality...and age beautifully. Because living longer isn&#x2019;t about dodging disease, but about sustaining a high quality of life for years to come.</p><p>The body is the most fascinating machine ever created, and nobody talks about it in ways that are as illuminating and compelling as Dr. Michael Roizen and Dr. Mehmet Oz. Most people think of the aging of our bodies the same way we think of the aging of our cars: the older we get, the more inevitable it is that we're going to break down. Most of us believe that at age 40 or so, we begin the slow and steady decline of our minds, our eyes, our ears, our joints, our arteries, our libido, and every other system that affects the quality of life (and how long we live it). But according to Dr. Roizen and Dr. Oz, that's a mistake.<p></p><p> Aging isn't a decline in our systems. It's actually very purposeful. The very systems and biological processes that age us are designed to help us when we're a little bit younger. So what's our role as part of the aging population? To learn how those systems work so we can reprogram them to work the way they did when we were younger. Your goal should be: die young at any age. That means you live a high quality of life (with everything from working joints to working genitals) until the day you die.</p><p></p><p> At the core of this landmark book are the Major Agers--14 biological processes that control your rate of aging. Some you've heard of, some you haven't, and some you never knew contributed to the aging process. Some speed decline, others inhibit your repair mechanisms. These Major Agers are everything from short telomeres and inefficient mitochondria to stem cells and wacky hormones. The doctors explain the principles of longevity and many of the causes of aging and how to fight the effects. The climax of the book is a 14-day plan to help you along your path to staying young. The doctors want you to be able to integrate important processes into your daily life in order to make staying young routine, but first you'll need to measure your real age and health right now. Staying young encompasses your emotions and mental health as well as your exercise habits, eating habits, personal hygiene, and genes, among other things.</p><p></p><p> Wouldn't you like to know how to prevent your body from aging badly? The original YOU book showed how bodies work in general, and <i>YOU: On a Diet</i> explained how bodies lose weight and stay fit. Now in <i>YOU: Staying Young</i>, Drs. Michael Roizen and Mehmet Oz illuminate the mysterious mechanisms with a lively metaphor -- the modern city. What differentiates a vibrant and thriving city that ages gracefully from one that is worn down and rusted out? Despite genetic differences, which are like the geography upon which the city is built, cities age differently because of the way residents treat their education system (stem cells), power plants (mitochondria), electrical grids (brains), transportation routes (blood vessels), and landfills (fat). You -- as mayor, resident, and street cleaner -- have the power to balance your biological budget to ensure a life that's both long and strong. Thankfully, just as cities can invest in renewal and improving their repair processes, so can you.</p><p></p><p> <i>YOU: Staying Young</i> is filled with signature YOU Tools, including YOU Tests, YOU Tips, and visual and verbal metaphors to bring the science to life.</p><p></p><p> </p> <p> <strong>A Letter from Michael Roizen and Mehmet Oz</strong> </p><p> Dear Amazon Shoppers: </p><p> Our books, <i>YOU: The Owner&#x2019;s Manual</i> and <i>YOU: On a Diet</i>, have become #1 Amazon and <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, and we thank you. Many people have asked us questions about aging. We want you to know that the science in the last very few years has challenged the very perceptions of aging. </p><p> Most of us tend to have the same view of the way people age: As we grow older, we start losing things. We lose some hair, lose our minds, lose our balance, lose our eyesight, lose a little of this and a lot of that until we eventually wither away into a hunched-over senior who takes 3-inch steps and eats dinner at 4:00 pm. But to think that a life of frailty is an inevitable outcome of aging is a mistake. And the fact that we don't take control of it is because we have excuses. We live in a society where making excuses is as easy as making a sandwich. Nowhere is that more apparent than when it comes to your own health. The reason why we are frazzled with stress? Blame the boss. The reason why we are sick? Blame the sniffling kids. The reason why our society&#x2019;s waistbands are stretching and snapping at alarming rates? Blame Auntie's alfredo sauce. The top health excuse, however, revolves around the biggest four-letter word of them all, the GENE. We blame our genes for just about everything--for baldness, for fatness, for illness and for every other health-related problem we can think of. In our minds, that means that our mom, pop, and the rest of the family tree are all on the hook for the ultimate health question of them all--how long and how well we will live? </p><p> But that is exactly where more of us have it wrong. While we are certainly born with genes that help determine everything from our height to our risk of heart disease, we are making a monumental mistake by assuming that we can&#x2019;t control our genes--especially when it comes to aging. </p><p> Perhaps the best way to explain the dynamics of aging is to take a look at another complex system that is subjected to the same forces as your body: a city. Some cities remain beautiful and elegant in their old age, while younger ones may look worn down and beat-up. Now, every city has its own genetic code, just as you do. For a city, genes are geography; whether it's built on a river or whether it's located in a hot or cold climate, or whether it lies directly in a prevalent hurricane path. A city's geography can't change. But the city can adapt to the environment with earthquake-proof construction, with underground tunnels for walking in wintertime, or with strong levies. The adaptation the city makes to survive and to thrive is what is crucial to its vitality. </p><p> The same goes for you. </p><p> Just because you have been dealt a genetic hand that predisposes you to heart disease or diabetes or the wearing of pants as large as a parachute doesn't mean you can't mitigate the effects of those genes. One of the major things we will teach you is that while you can't change your genes, you can change whether they are turned on or off or how you express them. Just like a city, you can compensate elegantly if you understand your options. </p><p> For the first time in history, the medical world has uncovered many of the miraculous biologic processes that control how and why we age. Truth is, much of aging is actually in our control; with the power to nudge our biologic systems so that our unwanted genes can work in our favor--as long as you know what to do and how you are doing it. In <i>YOU: Staying Young</i>, we translate the latest science (much of which wasn't available even three years ago) to help slow your rate of aging. You will learn 14 Major Agers, and dozens of action steps so that you can take control of those agers and your aging processes. </p><p> We hope you enjoy the cartoons, analogies, and jokes. But ultimately we hope you soak in the message: Your health is largely in your control. We dedicate the book to all who desire longer life so they can serve more. </p><p> Thanks very much, </p><p> Mike and Mehmet </p> <p> <strong>A Look Inside <i>You: Staying Young</i></strong> </p><p> Take a look inside <i>You: Staying Young</i> with these three excerpted charts, full of crucial, easy-to-digest information that you can start using today:</p><p> </p><ul> <li>Fuel Your Fighters: One of the best ways to pump up your immune system is by eating the foods and getting the nutrients that have been shown to improve your natural defenses.</li> <li>Your Vital Supplements: The doctors' recommendations of pills and supplements that will make your body and mind stronger, healthier, and younger.

It isn't that hard and doesn't take that long. In fact, even if you have had burgers for breakfast or fried your brain cells with stress by noon, you're not necessarily destined to wear husky pants, forget birthdays, and spiral into a state of complete upheaval. That's right: You get a do-over in life if you want it. Repeat after us: not hard, not long. </p><p> <strong>Q:</strong> Is there one food, vitamin, mineral, exercise, or lifestyle change that does more to combat aging than any other? </p><p> <strong>A:</strong> Our top choices in terms of ease and impact:</p><ul> <li>Walk 30 minutes a day and call someone after you do it. No excuses, walk every day. If you do it, you'll have the courage, health, and attitude to adopt other changes too.</li> <li>Take 2 grams of omega-3 fats every day in form of either walnuts, fish oil, or DHA supplements.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is one of the most surprising contributors to aging that we can easily remove from our lifestyles? </p><p><strong>A:</strong> Inflammation of our teeth. Remove it with daily flossing and brushing and seeing a dental professional regularly. You won't just save your teeth; you'll also go a long way in saving your heart and arteries. Another? Our lack of turmeric--curry and mustard (mustard on stadium hot dogs does not qualify). Both of those ingredients make your memory better. </p><p> <strong>Q:</strong> What are some of the immediate benefits you will notice from following the tips in the book? </p><p> <strong>A:</strong> You will feel younger. You might get hit upon by strangers or be mistaken for someone 20 years younger. In addition to the waist size you'll lose, your new attitude and vitality for life may give your reading choice away. </p><p> <strong>Q:</strong> How early should most people start to focus on slowing the aging process? </p><p> <strong>A:</strong> The aging process starts in your teens or even before, but any time you start is better than later. (Repeat: not hard, not long.) Your cells basically have a memory of three years. So by changing your habits now, within three years, it's as if you have done your healthy habit all your life. </p> <p> <strong> Getting to Know <i>YOU</i></strong> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td><br><i>YOU: Staying Young</i> [Audio CD] </td> <td><br><i>YOU: Staying Young</i> Workout DVD </td> <td><br><i>YOU: On a Diet</i> </td> <td><br><i>YOU: The Smart Patient</i> </td> <td><br><i>YOU: The Owner's Manual</i> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p></p>Michael F.

However, Unequal and Unrepresented finds that political voice in America is not only unequal but also unrepresentative. Those who are well educated and affluent carry megaphones. The less privileged speak in a whisper. Relying on three decades of research and an enormous wealth of information about politically active individuals and organizations, Kay Schlozman, Henry Brady, and Sidney Verba offer a concise synthesis and update of their groundbreaking work on political participation. </p><p>The authors consider the many ways that citizens in American democracy can influence public outcomes through political voice: by voting, getting involved in campaigns, communicating directly with public officials, participating online or offline, acting alone and in organizations, and investing their time and money. Socioeconomic imbalances characterize every form of political voice, but the advantage to the advantaged is especially pronounced when it comes to any form of political expression--for example, lobbying legislators or making campaign donations&#x2015;that relies on money as an input. With those at the top of the ladder increasingly able to spend lavishly in politics, political action anchored in financial investment weighs ever more heavily in what public officials hear. </p><p>Citing real-life examples and examining inequalities from multiple perspectives, <i>Unequal and Unrepresented</i> shows how disparities in political voice endanger American democracy today.</p></p><p><p>"Widening inequalities of income and wealth are causing widening inequalities of political voice, and the financial investments of the wealthy weigh ever more heavily in what public officials hear.

And Ginny finds plenty to write about: Pennsylvania Volunteers arrive in the town square reporting a big battle in Virginia and calling for more men to join their ranks. Rumors fly that the Rebs are headed to Gettysburg, and the Battle of Gettysburg ensues. Suddenly, Ginny's quiet town is filled with the injured.<br><br>Ginny's brother Jed has joined the Union army, and they find him wounded in a makeshift hospital. With Ginny's nursing, he recovers, and Ginny is is able to witness the President's Gettysburg Address.</p><p>Virginia Dickens is angry. Her father and brother Jed have left her behind while they go off to Uncle Jack's farm to help him hide his horses from Confederate raiders. It's the summer of 1863 and Pa and Jed believe 9-year-old Virginia will be out of harm's way in the sleepy little town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Too soon they all discover how wrong they are, as Union and Confederate soldiers descend on Gettysburg for the bloodiest battle of the Civil War. Virginia has front-row seats to this horrific episode of history, and she records every incident and feeling she experiences in her journal (which is actually Jed's; he entrusted it to her when he went away, asking her to be his "eyes and ears in Gettysburg"). <p> Mary Pope Osborne's gripping story is a welcome addition to the popular My America historical-fiction series. Neither Osborne nor Virginia shy away from telling the truth, brutal and painful though it may be. This lends a certain depth, appeal, and integrity to the book that a history textbook could never match. Real players in the Civil War, including Robert E. Lee and Abe Lincoln, make cameo appearances, while the fictional characters seem just as authentic. Osborne has written a wide variety of other engaging stories, including <i>Adaline Falling Star</i>. (Ages 8 to 11) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Grade 3-5-Resembling the "Dear America" books (Scholastic), these titles are aimed at a slightly younger audience. In the first book, nine-year-old Elizabeth records her experiences as she, her family, and other colonists adjust to the harsh weather conditions, illness, endless hard work, and nascent social strata in the new land. In the course of three months, Elizabeth meets Captain John Smith, Pocahontas, Gabriel Archer, and George Percy. This is a quick, easy read. Hermes has created a sensitive main character and readers will empathize with her fears and emotions as she adjusts to her new life. In My Brother's Keeper, nine-year-old Virginia Dickens is left in the care of Reverend and Mrs. McCully while her father and brother help her uncle hide his horses from the Confederate raiders. Her journal documents the battle at Gettysburg and the horrors of war. After the battle, she and her father find her brother in a makeshift hospital. The novel ends as the town slowly recovers and Virginia hears President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Osborne successfully creates individual characters, and she poses difficult questions about war and the waste of human life. There is a lyrical quality to several passages, and the author slowly builds suspense and release. However, this book seems more fitting for older, more experienced readers, and the intended audience may have difficulty digesting some of the material.

Significantly, there is no trace of the specious and pretensious nihilism that is so often claimed as the hallmark of his thinking.

Her Times article on her own near-fatal attack of toxic shock syndrome won her the Pulitzer Prize and reached 2 million people. Her research for this book included hundreds of interviews with A.A.s historic figures and rank-and-file members across the nationFounded in the 1930s by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith, who sought to help each other stay sober one day at a time, Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) has grown from that shaky fellowship to a world-wide organization of some two million men and women. These two books approach the self-help organization from very different viewpoints. Anyone whose life has been touched in any way by alcoholism will find much of interest in Robertson's book, not least in the story of her own triumphant battle with alcoholism. Robertson, a reporter for the New York Times , provides a highly readable account of the history A.A., not only telling us how it works but giving insight on why. She successfully demystifies the role of religion in A.A. and provides compelling portraits of the co-founders and of various members around the world. Unfortunately, Pittman's book does not engage the reader's attention so forcefully, too often reading like a dissertation. It does provide an interesting historical perspective on the concept of alcoholism as disease, focusing on theories of causation, classification, and treatment from the 1890s to the 1930s. Lengthy but uninspired attention is given to Wilson, but co-founder Smith is hardly mentioned. And although Robertson states that the text of her book was read, edited, and approved by A.A. members in New York and Akron, as required by A.A., Pittman makes no such assertion. Robertson's book is highly recommended. Buy Pittman if demand warrants. Jodith Janes, Univ.

Anyone wishing to tie a cherry stem with one's tongue or surreptitiously steal an appetizer from a dining companion's plate would do well to study this invaluable text. Written in the voice of the large, ponytailed Penn--the smaller, balder Teller never speaks--this volume divulges bizarre uses for coffee-creamer containers; offers a fake recipe for "Swedish Lemon Angels" that creates a frothing "volcano" by blending reactive ingredients; and debunks a popular magician's ploy by explaining how to bend spoons and move plates through "psychokinesis." Several card tricks here require the collusion of restaurant staff, and thus may be hard to achieve without shelling out healthy tips. Not to worry, though--plenty of other sick games await those who prefer affordable (not to say cheap) gags.

Dr. Grover Krantz has the distinction of being one of the few scientists who accepts the existence of the legendary &#34;bigfoot&#34;. With a doctoral degree in physical anthropology from the University of Minnesota and additional training from U.C.

Dr. Krantz dismisses all of the paranormal and pseudoscientific interpretations of the sasquatch phenomena, and instead analyzes the mystery from the standpoint of a zoologist.

This seminal book expands on his original work to address the fundamental and far-reaching themes of the new millennium. The result is nothing short of an historical and philosophical primer for the onslaught of the 21st century. &#39;In the mastery and scope of its case, &#34;The End of History and the Last Man&#34; may be seen as the first book of the post-Marxist millennium - the first work fully to fathom the depth and range of the changes now sweeping through the world&#39; - George Gilder, the &#34;Washington Post&#34;.</p><p>Francis Fukuyama was born in Chicago in 1952. His work includes America at the Crossroads: Democracy, Power, and the Neoconservative Legacy and After the Neo Cons: Where the Right went Wrong. He now lives in Washington D.C. with his wife and children, where he also works as a part time photographer.In 1989, The National Interest published ``The End of History?'' by Fukuyama, then a senior official at the State Department. In that comparatively short but extremely controversial article, Fukuyama speculated that liberal democracy may constitute the ``end point of mankind's ideological evolution'' and hence the ``final form of human government.'' Now Fukuyama has produced a brilliant book that, its title notwithstanding, takes an almost entirely new tack. To begin with, he examines the problem of whether it makes sense to posit a coherent and directional history that would lead the greater part of humanity to liberal democracy. Having answered in the affirmative, he assesses the regulatory effect of modern natural science, a societal activity consensually deemed cumulative as well as directional in its impact. Turning next to a ``second, parallel account of the historical process,'' Fukuyama considers humanity's struggle for recognition, a concept articulated and borrowed (from Plato) by Hegel. In this context, he goes on to reinterpret culture, ethical codes, labor, nationalism, religion, war, and allied phenomena from the past, projecting ways in which the desire for acknowledgement could become manifest in the future. Eventually, the author addresses history's presumptive end and the so-called ``last man,'' an unheroic construct (drawn from Tocqueville and Nietzsche) who has traded prideful belief in individual worth for the civilized comforts of self-preservation. Assuming the prosperity promised by contemporary liberal democracy indeed come to pass, Fukuyama wonders whether or how the side of human personality that thrives on competition, danger, and risk can be fulfilled in the sterile ambiance of a brave new world. At the end, the author leaves tantalizingly open the matter of whether mankind's historical journey is approaching a close or another beginning; he even alludes to the likelihood that time travelers may well strike out in directions yet undreamt. An important work that affords significant returns on the investments of time and attention required to get the most from its elegantly structured theme. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He also interviews members and ex-members of the doomsdays cult responsible, in the hope that they might be able to explain the reason for the attack and how it was that their guru instilled such devotion in his followers.</p><p>It was a clear spring day, Monday, March 20, 1995, when five members of the religious cult Aum Shinrikyo conducted chemical warfare on the Tokyo subway system using sarin, a poison gas twenty-six times as deadly as cyanide. The unthinkable had happened, a major urban transit system had become the target of a terrorist attack.<p>In an attempt to discover why, Haruki Murakami, internationally acclaimed author of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and arguably Japan's most important contemporary novelist, talked to the people who lived through the catastrophe -- from a Subway Authority employee with survivor guilt, to a fashion salesman with more venom for the media than for the perpetrators, to a young cult member who vehemently condemns the attack though he has not quit Aum. Through these and many other voices, Murakami exposes intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche. And as he discerns the fundamental issues leading to the attack, we achieve a clear vision of an event that could occur anytime, anywhere. Hauntingly compelling and inescapably important, Underground is a powerful work of journalistic literature from one of the world's most perceptive writers.</p>From Haruki Murakami, internationally acclaimed author of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle" and Norwegian Wood, a work of literary journalism that is as fascinating as it is necessary, as provocative as it is profound. <br>In March of 1995, agents of a Japanese religious cult attacked the Tokyo subway system with sarin, a gas twenty-six times as deadly as cyanide. Attempting to discover why, Murakami conducted hundreds of interviews with the people involved, from the survivors to the perpetrators to the relatives of those who died, and Underground is their story in their own voices. Concerned with the fundamental issues that led to the attack as well as these personal accounts, Underground is a document of what happened in Tokyo as well as a warning of what could happen anywhere. This is an enthralling and unique work of nonfiction that is timely and vital and as wonderfully executed as Murakami's brilliant novels.<br></p><h2>Encyclopedia of American Farm Implements &amp; Antiques</h2><p>Never before has such a detailed story been told of the machinery, tools, and implements used on farms on a daily basis.

White in 1864 began to speak and write on proper nutrition and a way of living that took into account nature&#39;s laws, average life expectancy in the United States was 32 years; meals, served three, four, or five times a day, were highly spiced, heavy with meats, rich gravies, fried foods, and a vast array of pastries loaded with sugar and fat. Milk was often supplied by cows poorly cared for and sometimes tuberculous. Testing was unknown, and pasteurization was decades away. Except for salting and drying, the science of food preservation was still in the future. It was in this climate that Ellen White, with a pen dipped in the wisdom and knowledge of the Designer of the human form and the Author of nature&#39;s laws, called for a dietary program that was simple, healthful, nutritious, and appetizing. To this end she spoke for fifty years, writing her views in articles, books, and personal correspondence. Nutritionists today are aware of people&#39;s resistance to changes in their diet. Yet Ellen White succeeded in changing the dietary practices of hundreds of thousands who today profitably follow these counsels, now well supported by scientific research.

His books include <i>American Pop Art</i> and <i>Topics in American Art since 1945.</i> He has also written extensively for various art journals and was art critic for <i>The Nation</i> and co-editor of <i>Art Criticism.</i> <br>Excerpt from: <b> <i>Roy Lichtenstein</i> </b> <br> <br>Introduction<br> <br>This book begins in the early 1960s, when Roy Lichtenstein was an exhibiting artist with more than ten years work behind him. That early work includes imagery of the nineteenth-century Far West and of American history, painted 1952-55, and an Abstract Expressionist phase, 1957-60. Why start a book on an artist after such well-developed periods? In 1961, my starting point, Lichtenstein&#x2019;s paintings became flatter, simpler, and more highly finished, but at the same time he embraced popular culture as subject matter. This is the point at which his personal career converged with the public interest or, to put it another way, when he entered contemporary art history. Lichtenstein became a representative artist of his generation (born in the 1920s), in the most demanding art center in the world New York. That is the reason for starting at this date.<br> <br>It is not my purpose to minimize Lichtenstein&#x2019;s origins and indeed, some of this early work is reproduced here but it seems more appropriate for the present to discuss the unity of his work in the last twenty years, as opposed to a recent tendency to divide it, and to discuss iconography as an intrinsic part of his art, hence the long chapter on the uses of quotation (chapter 5). I assume him to be a painter first, and since this is a short book I have concentrated accordingly on what seems to be the mainline, although the various periods of his sculpture are discussed briefly.<br> <br>If we follow the sequence of an artist&#x2019;s development, as the monograph form invites us to do, we are essentially involved in an act of shadowing. The written account is an analogue of the order of events, stylistic or biographical, in the artists life. Biography today is stretched between revelation and gossip. The revelatory mode shows the artist in extreme states of stress (Vincent van Gogh, Jackson Pollock), and gossip shows the artist as being like ourselves in the short term (Calvin Tomkins&#x2019;s book on Robert Rauschenberg is like this). The drama of the first mode is not Lichtenstein&#x2019;s style, and he has successfully avoided the domain of gossip. Biography in his case therefore rests largely on his profession; this withdrawal of art from the demonstrative can also be seen in studies of Frank Stella by William S. Rubin and Ellsworth Kelly by Eugene C. Goossen.<br> <br>Lichtenstein was born in New York in 1923 and attended the Franklin School. Art was not taught there but he drew and painted at home, and when he left high school enrolled in summer art classes at the Art Students League under Reginald Marsh. He entered the School of Fine Arts, Ohio State University, in 1940 and was much influenced by Hoyt L. Sherman&#x2019;s systematic analysis of picture construction. After being drafted by the U.S. Army and serving from 1943 to 1946, he returned to Ohio State to get his B.F.A. in 1946 and M.F.A. in 1949. In the 1950s he held several one-artist shows in New York galleries and taught, first at the State University of New York at Oswego and then, from 1960 to 1963, at Douglass College, Rutgers University, New Jersey. Here his contact with artists was extended to include Allan Kaprow, George Segal, and Robert Watts, among others. Thus he occupied a solid professional niche when in 1961 he began his Pop paintings.<br> <br>In the 1950s, when he was both teaching and painting, Lichtenstein was acting as many artists do who need a second job to survive. In 1961 the original way of working that he formulated proved to have analogies with that of his contemporaries, and as soon as 1962 he was taken on by an exceptionally influential dealer, Leo Castelli. With his backing Lichtenstein was able to support himself purely as an artist, and in 1964, after a years leave of absence from Rutgers University, he resigned from teaching. Lichtenstein responded to this freedom by producing an abundant oeuvre, both purposeful and varied, as we shall see. His success was remarkable, leading to early retrospectives: in 1967 at the Pasadena Art Museum and two years later at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, both of which traveled to other museums in the U.S. and Europe. Given Lichtenstein&#x2019;s reticence and his concentration as an artist, his biography is identified with his production rather than events outside the studio. The graph of professional achievement replaces the erratic tracks of personal day-to-day behavior. The artists development becomes of prime significance, not as it produces timeless objects but as a record in time of work done. This is not art for arts sake but art as evidence of a work ethic, validated by intensity of production and the pace of coherent change.<br> <br>The logical succession of Roy Lichtenstein&#x2019;s work, as we shall see, lends itself to a chronological ordering. The chief risk in this lies in the possibility of missing other kinds of order. Because the chronicle form emphasizes linearity it may lose sight of patterns of thematic recurrence, which call for a mode of criticism that crosses time rather than follows its succession. In what follows I have tried to indicate such recurrences, including the reappearance of the single image at different points in Lichtenstein&#x2019;s work and his changing use of other peoples art.<br> <br>There is a large picture book on Lichtenstein&#x2019;s work of the 1960s by Diane Waldman and a book on the work of the 70s by Jack Cowart, both based on exhibitions. This monograph, covering both decades, aims to show Lichtenstein&#x2019;s work as a continuous project. Introductions are written after books are finished, when the author knows what he or she has done, and this turned out to be my purpose: I want to represent Lichtenstein&#x2019;s work from 1961 as a unity, though not a simple unit.<br> <br>According to Cowart, "by 1970 the artist had left a Pop style and begun to employ new compositional lines." He proposes a chronological break in the artists development Pop art and after, coinciding with the two decades but is it real? As I see it, the decades are linked stylistically and psychologically: the aesthetic premises of the 1960s are maintained, but amplified and enriched. When Lichtenstein began his paintings derived from comics in 1961 he was in his late thirties. What does one expect of artists at this time of life?: that they know their way and be in command of a personal style. For most artists, development consists in the extension, not repudiation, of the ideas of their early maturity. The mystique of the breakthrough, of the life remade, associated with Abstract Expressionism is rarely supported by specific examples. Lichtenstein, who was fifty in 1973, has kept his base in Pop art. This is the artists own view: "Almost everything I&#x2019;m doing, he says, I did in the 60s." If this is the case, it is necessary to have a definition of Pop art that is in accord with Lichtenstein&#x2019;s subsequent practice. A broad definition of Pop art as art about signs seems more useful than the narrow one of art that uses commercial subject matter (see chapter 3). Like most American art movements since World War II, Pop art was never a group with a shared program, but the artists were affiliated by generational and ideological affinities, perhaps even by publicity.<br> <br>To key Lichtenstein&#x2019;s later work to his earlier does not suggest repetition, simply a coherent progression. Something of this can be seen by comparing three paintings done over a period of eighteen years. <i>Engagement Ring</i> (1961) has its tentative aspects: the screen of small benday-type dots used for the flesh is patchy, and the drawing, especially of the suitor&#x2019;s coat, is staccato. The painting has a rawness that carries over something of the original impact of Lichtenstein&#x2019;s work from the 1950s: one red is used for fingernails, lips, drapes, and wall, and one yellow for the blonde woman&#x2019;s scooped hair and the lampshade on the opposite side of the picture. At the same time, we can see the artist approaching the integrated formality of his later work: <i>Engagement Ring</i> is a fully characteristic painting, conceptually and manually, but it lacks the seamless aplomb that he was shortly to achieve.<br> <br>This can be seen handsomely in <i>We Rose Up Slowly</i> (1964). The woman is again blonde, the patterns of her hair echoed by undulant blue and purple lines that symbolize the underwater setting. The embracing couple occupy one panel and the caption a second: "We rose up slowly as if we didn&#x2019;t belong to the outside world any longer like swimmers in a shadowy dream who didn&#x2019;t need to breathe " The separation of words and image enables Lichtenstein to elaborate his linear and color conventions luxuriously. A part of this effect is the result of the tonal depth of the blue, which almost absorbs the sinuous black outlines. Also, the visual panel is square, providing space for a rich, equalized composition, neither horizontal nor vertical. The benday screens are smooth and even, capable of delicate color adjustment: the element of approximation in <i>Engagement Ring</i> has been brought within a canon of control.<br> <br>A later blonde appears in <i>Stepping Out</i> (1978), a picture that shows both the increasing systematization of Lichtenstein&#x2019;s procedures and the widening of his range of quotations. The woman is a Dali-esque invention, consisting of lips, one blue eye, and a hank of hair that flows before a small head-sized mirror. The male is quoted from late Fernand L�ger.

Yet in the late 1500s Englishmen had begun to hazard the venture, and in 1607 they planted their first permanent settlement on the North American continent at Jamestown. By the early 1730s, thirteen separate colonies hugged the seaboard. Although great diversity prevailed among the colonies, most colonists shared a common English heritage and clung to it tenaciously. Their religious attitudes, economic views, political thoughts, and military ideals and institutions were all grounded in English history. In no aspect of colonial life was this heritage more important than in regard to military matters. The colonists' most revered military institution (the militia) and their most cherished military tradition (fear of a standing army) both came from England. </p><p> <b>I</b> </p><p> The earliest English settlers arrived in a dangerous New World. The initial colonies represented little more than amphibious landings on a hostile coastline followed by the consolidation of small, insecure beach-heads. The settlers did not take possession of an uninhabited land, but settled in regions controlled by various native American tribes. Fortunately for the colonists, they unwittingly landed in areas that had recently experienced precipitous population losses among the Indians. </p><p> Europeans made periodic contact with the natives long before they established permanent colonies. These transient visitors left a devastating legacy of smallpox, measles, and other European diseases, for which the natives had no built-in immunities. But the colonists soon learned that the Indians, even in their weakened state, were a formidable adversary. Nor were Indians the only military threat. The English settled in lands also claimed by their European rivals, and the memory of the raids conducted by the Spanish, French, and English against each other's out-posts in the Caribbean and along the Florida coast undoubtedly haunted many colonists. The fear of pillaging buccaneers and pirates who infested coastal waterways compounded the potential problem posed by European enemies. </p><p> Colonists faced these threats alone. Although the English monarch authorized their expeditions and granted extensive lands for settlement, the Crown expected the colonists to defend themselves. With few illusions about their precarious position, colonists came to the New World armed and, anticipating conflict, gave prompt attention to defense. Professional soldiers accompanied the expeditions to Jamestown, Plymouth, and succeeding colonies. Indeed, the first heroes in American history were far from ordinary settlers. The profit-seeking Virginia Company hired Captain John Smith, a veteran of Europe's religious wars, to teach military skills to the settlers at Jamestown in 1607. Other experienced soldiers, such as Lord De La Warr, Sir Thomas Gates, and Sir Thomas Dale, soon followed him. The pious Pilgrims wisely did not rely on God's favor alone for protection, employing Captain Myles Standish, a veteran of the Dutch wars for independence, to ensure Plymouth's success. Although Smith and Standish are the most famous of the soldier-settlers, practically all the other colonies had similar veterans who provided military leadership during the founding period. The importance placed on military preparations could be seen in the attention given to fortifications. Less than a month after their arrival, the settlers at Jamestown had constructed a primitive, triangular fort, and by 1622 the Pilgrims had erected a 2,700-foot-long defensive perimeter guarding their fledgling plantation. </p><p> The most important response to the dangerous military realities was the creation of a militia system in each colony. The British military heritage, the all-pervasive sense of military insecurity, and the inability of the economically poor colonies to maintain an expensive professional army all combined to guarantee that the Elizabethan militia would be transplanted to the North American wilderness. No colonial institution was more complex than the militia. In many respects it was static and homogeneous, varying little from colony to colony and from generation to generation. Yet the militia was also evolutionary and heterogeneous, as diverse as the thirteen colonies and ever-changing within individual colonies. </p><p> At the heart of the militia was the principle of universal military obligation for all able-bodied males. Colonial laws regularly declared that all able-bodied men between certain ages automatically belonged to the militia. Yet within the context of this immutable principle, variations abounded. While the normal age limits were from 16 to 60, this was not universal practice. Connecticut, for example, began with an upper age limit of 60 but gradually reduced it to 45. Sometimes the lower age limit was 18 or even 21. Each colony also established occupational exemptions from militia training. Invariably the exemption list began small but grew to become a seemingly endless list that reduced the militia's theoretical strength. </p><p> If a man was in the militia, he participated in periodic musters, or training days, with the other members of his unit. Attendance at musters was compulsory; militia laws levied fines for nonattendance. During the initial years of settlement, when dangers seemed particularly acute, musters were frequent. However, as the Indian threat receded, the trend was toward fewer muster days, and by the early 1700s most colonies had decided that four peacetime musters per year were sufficient. </p><p> Whether few or many, muster days helped forge a link between religious duty and military service, particularly in New England. An integral part of each training day (and of all military expeditions) was a sermon, which invariably fostered an aggressive militancy by emphasizing that the Bible sanctioned martial activity and that warfare was a true Christian's sacred duty. "Hence it is no wayes unbecoming a Christian to learn to be a Souldier," chaplain Samuel Nowell preached to Massachusetts militiamen in 1678, because being a soldier was "a Credit, a praise and a glory." When the colonists unsheathed their swords, they did so in God's name, serene in the belief that the Lord was on their side against their heathen and Papist enemies and that whatever happened was God's will. </p><p> Militiamen had to provide and maintain their own weapons. Militia laws detailed the required weaponry, which underwent a rapid evolution in the New World. Initially a militiaman was armed much like a European soldier, laden with armor, equipped with either a pike or matchlock musket, and carrying a sword. But Indian warfare was not European warfare, and most of this weaponry proved of limited value. By the mid-1670s colonial armaments had been revolutionized. Armor, which made it difficult to traverse rugged terrain and pursue Indians, disappeared. Pikes were equally cumbersome and of little use against Indians, who neither stood their ground when assaulted nor made massed charges. At times the matchlock was superior to Indian bows and arrows, but its disadvantages were many. It took two minutes to load, and misfired approximately three times in every ten shots. The weapon discharged when a slow-burning match came in contact with the priming powder, but keeping the match lit on rainy or windy days was difficult, and the combination of a burning match and gunpowder in close proximity often resulted in serious accidents. The flintlock musket replaced the matchlock. Depending on flint scraping against steel for discharge, flintlocks could be loaded in thirty seconds and misfired less often. Swords remained common weapons, but colonists increasingly preferred hatchets for close-quarter combat. Although both weapons were valuable in a melee, hatchets were also useful for a variety of domestic purposes. </p><p> Militia laws emphasized the importance of a well-armed citizenry in numerous ways. To ensure that each man had the requisite weapons and accoutrements, colonies instituted a review of arms, imposing the duty. of conducting it on militia officers, muster masters, or other specially appointed officials. Every colony's law detailed how destitute citizens could be armed at public expense, and legislatures provided for public arsenals to supplement individually owned armaments. Colonies also required that even men exempted from attending musters should be completely armed and equipped. </p><p> Although the basic tactical unit in all the colonies was the company, or trainband, regional variations and changes over time were as important as the superficial uniformity. No standardized company size existed, some companies containing as few as sixty-five men and others as many as two hundred. Some trainbands elected their officers, but in others the governors appointed them. Southern colonies, with widely dispersed populations, often organized companies on a countywide basis, while in New England, with its towns and villages, individual communities contained their own trainbands. As populations increased and the number of trainbands grew, colonies organized companies into regiments to preserve efficient management. As one last example of the variety and change within militia units, the initial all-infantry composition evolved into a mixture of infantry and mounted units, the latter providing increased maneuverability and speed, which were valuable assets in Indian warfare. </p><p> Militia officers, like colonial politicians, overwhelmingly came from the upper class, and men moved with ease from important political positions into high military offices and vice versa. The practice of plural office holding, whereby a man simultaneously held political and military office, epitomized the integration of political and military leadership. For example, in Salem, Massachusetts, between 1765 and 1774 twelve of the twenty-nine active militia officers also held important positions in the municipal government.

He is the author of the acclaimed books Outcats and History of the Blues and a biography of John Coltrane (Knopf). He lives in Philadelphia.Davis ambitiously chronicles one of the oldest American musical genres that remain thriving today, and because of his astute observations, personable wit, and challenging proposals, produces what is clearly one of the best books on it. Effectively using a first-person perspective, Davis explores the history of the blues throughout the rural South, its evolution in northern cities, and the marketing of vintage and contemporary blues musicians today. Moreover, he places the music's development within the context of general American cultural and social development. His commentary embraces such high-profile players as Bessie Smith, Robert Johnson, and Muddy Waters as well as such far less known figures as Johnny "Daddy Stovepipe" Watson. Davis points out that modern country music and the blues share a common genesis in rural medicine shows, and he is courageous enough to make the politically unfashionable declaration that Elvis was "one of the finest singers ever spawned by the Southern United States" and then provide enough reasons to back up the claim. Companion to a new PBS TV series, this book is, like Davis' two collections of jazz articles, <i>In the Moment</i> (1987) and <i>Outcats</i> (1990), essential for the music library shelves. <i>Aaron Cohen</i></p><h2>Detectives in togas</h2><p>In these two delightful history-mysteries, seven boys in Ancient Rome solve strange crimes . . . thanks to some help from their cranky teacher, a little bit of logic, and a lot of amusing misadventure.<br><br>Yes, Rufus wrote CAIUS IS A DUMBBELL on his tablet at school, but no, he did <i>not </i>break into the schoolroom, did <i>not</i> tie up his teacher, and certainly did <i>not </i>paint his slur about Caius on the Temple of Minerva (even if it <i>is </i>in Rufus's own handwriting).

The physical and spiritual survival methods eventually immortalized by Japan&#39;s Ninja were in fact one of the sources of Japanese martial arts. Without complete and total training in all aspects of the combative arts, today&#39;s martial artist cannot hope to progress any further than mere proficiency in the limited set of muscular skills that make up his or her training system. Personal enlightenment can only come about through total immersion in the martial tradition as a way of living. By experiencing the confrontation of danger, the transcendence of fear or injury or death, and a working knowledge of individual personal powers and limitations, the practitioner of ninjutsu can gain the strength and invincibility that permit enjoyment of the flowers moving in the wind, appreciation of the love of others, and contentment with the presence of peace in society. The attainment of this enlightenment is characterized by the development of the jihi no kokoro, or benevolent heart. Stronger than love itself, the benevolent heart is capable of encompassing all that constitutes universal justice and all that finds expression i n the unfolding of the universal scheme. Born of the insight attained from repeated exposure to the very brink between life and death, ninpo&#39;s benevolent heart is the key to finding harmony and understanding in the realms of the spiritual and natural material worlds. After so many generations of obscurity in the shadowy recesses of history, the life philosophy of the ninja is now once again emerging, because once again, it is the time in human destiny in which ninpo is needed. May peace prevail so that mankind may continue to grow and evolve into the next great plateau.</p><p></p><h2>The State of the American Mind: 16 Leading Critics on the New Anti-Intellectualism</h2><p>In 1987, Allan Bloom&#x2019;s <i>The Closing of the American Mind </i>was published; a wildly popular book that drew attention to the shift in American culture away from the tenants that made America&#x2014;and Americans&#x2014;unique. Bloom focused on a breakdown in the American curriculum, but many sensed that the issue affected more than education. The very essence of what it meant to be an American was disappearing.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was over twenty years ago. Since then, the United States has experienced unprecedented wealth, more youth enrolling in higher education than ever before, and technology advancements far beyond what many in the 1980s dreamed possible. And yet, the state of the American mind seems to have deteriorated further. Benjamin Franklin&#x2019;s &#x201c;self-made man&#x201d; has become a man dependent on the state. Independence has turned into self-absorption. Liberty has been curtailed in the defense of multiculturalism.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In order to fully grasp the underpinnings of this shift away from the self-reliant, well-informed American, editors Mark Bauerlein and Adam Bellow have brought together a group of cultural and educational experts to discuss the root causes of the decline of the American mind. &nbsp;The writers of these fifteen original essays include E. D. Hirsch, Nicholas Eberstadt, and Dennis Prager, as well as Daniel Dreisbach, Gerald Graff, Richard Arum, Robert Whitaker, David T. Z. Mindich, Maggie Jackson, Jean Twenge, Jonathan Kay, Ilya Somin, Steve Wasserman, Greg Lukianoff, and R. R. Reno.

But in early 1975, when North Vietnamese forces began a full-scale assault, Congress refused to send arms or aid. By early April that year, the South was on the brink of a defeat that threatened execution or years in a concentration camp for the untold number of South Vietnamese who had supported the government in Saigon or worked with Americans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thurston Clarke begins&nbsp;<i>Honorable Exit</i>&nbsp;by describing the iconic photograph of the Fall of Saigon: desperate Vietnamese scrambling to board a helicopter evacuating the last American personnel from Vietnam. It is an image of U.S. failure and shame. Or is it? By unpacking the surprising story of heroism that the photograph actually tells, Clarke launches into a narrative that is both a thrilling race against time and an important corrective to the historical record. For what is less known is that during those final days, scores of Americans--diplomats, businessmen, soldiers, missionaries, contractors, and spies--risked their lives to assist their current and former translators, drivers, colleagues, neighbors, friends, and even perfect strangers in escape. By the time the last U.S. helicopter left Vietnam on April 30, 1975, these righteous Americans had helped to spirit 130,000 South Vietnamese to U.S. bases in Guam and the Philippines. From there, the evacuees were resettled in the U.S. and became American citizens, the leading edge of one of America's most successful immigrant groups.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into this tale of heroism on the ground Clarke weaves the political machinations of Henry Kissinger advising President Ford in the White House while reinforcing the delusions of the U.S. Ambassador in Saigon, who, at the last minute, refused to depart. Groundbreaking, page-turning, and authoritative,&nbsp;<i>Honorable Exit</i>&nbsp;is a deeply moving history of Americans at a little-known finest hour.</p><p><b>Thurston Clarke</b> is the author of nine widely acclaimed works of fiction and nonfiction, including&nbsp;<i>California Fault</i>, a<i>&nbsp;New York Times</i>&nbsp;notable book;&nbsp;<i>Equator; By Blood and Fire; Pearl Harbor Ghosts,</i>&nbsp;the basis for the CBS Pearl Harbor documentary; and the bestselling&nbsp;<i>Lost Hero</i>, which was made into an award-winning NBC miniseries about Raoul Wallenberg.

Van Es grabbed his camera and a 300 mm lens and hurried onto the balcony. As a man in a white shirt was reaching down to help a per�son at the top of a staircase board the helicopter, Van Es took the last great iconic photograph of the Vietnam War. A UPI editor in Tokyo misidentified the building as the American embassy, and despite later corrections the mistake has survived in books, in articles, and on the internet, perhaps because placing the helicopter on the roof of the embassy makes the photograph a more potent symbol for America&#x2019;s first lost war.<br><br> Compare the Van Es photograph with the even more iconic one that Associated Press (AP) reporter Joe Rosenthal shot of six U.S. ser�vicemen raising an American flag on the summit of Mount Suribachi during the World War II battle for Iwo Jima. Both were taken near the end of a war, and both show Americans framed against an open sky&#x2014;reaching up to plant a flag or down to grab a refugee. Otherwise, they seem to have nothing in common. One symbolizes victory in a war Americans have spent decades celebrating; the other, defeat in a war they have spent decades trying to forget. One represents courage and sacrifice; the other, catastrophe and disgrace. But the more one learns about the staircase on the roof of 22 Gia Long Street, the people standing on it, the pilots of that helicopter, and the man in the white shirt, the more apparent it becomes that Van Es had also memorial�ized a moment of stirring heroism.<br><br> He later described the 22 Gia Long Street stairway as a &#x201c;make�shift wooden ladder.&#x201d; But zoom in from a different angle and with a stronger lens, as French photojournalist Philippe Buffon did that same afternoon, and it becomes a sturdy staircase wide enough to be climbed by four people abreast. Zoom in some more and the helicopter becomes a Bell Huey 205 painted in the blue and white livery of Air America, one of the CIA&#x2019;s proprietary airlines, and you can see that the man in the white shirt has a seven-day beard, a black patch over his left eye, and a cigar clenched in his teeth and that his shirt is ripped and filthy. Patrons of Saigon&#x2019;s rowdier bars would recognize him as Oren Bartholomew &#x201c;O. B.&#x201d; Harnage, the U.S. embassy&#x2019;s deputy air opera�tions officer and a middle-aged roustabout described by one friend as &#x201c;a gregarious, macho good old boy, a bull-shitter of the first order . . . [and] suds-sipper of renown.&#x201d; The cigar was one of the seven that Har�nage smoked daily, perhaps as an homage to his father, a Tampa cigar roller who had abandoned him at birth, in either 1925 or 1926&#x2014;he was uncertain which. He had volunteered for the navy at seventeen (or eighteen) and been wounded on Okinawa. A sliver of old shrapnel had worked its way into his left eye the previous month, explaining the patch. He had joined the air force after the war, moved to the CIA as a contract employee, and after seven years in Laos and Vietnam had concluded that America had been &#x201c;na�ve&#x201d; to involve itself in the Viet�nam War. <br><br> Earlier that afternoon CIA chief of station Thomas Polgar had asked him to commandeer one of the Air America helicopters that had been landing on the embassy roof and direct its pilots to 22 Gia Long Street to evacuate a group of Polgar&#x2019;s personal friends and senior South Vietnamese officials. Risking his life to rescue some dignitaries rubbed Harnage the wrong way. He decided instead to board everyone, he explained later, &#x201c;first come, first served . . . ladies and infants being the exception.&#x201d; After landing on the Gia Long Street roof, he punched out a burly Korean diplomat (a Polgar VIP) who had elbowed the other evacuees aside, and threw large suitcases&#x2014;some heavy with gold bars&#x2014;off the roof. Parents handed him their children before climbing back down the stairs in tears. Notes pinned to the children&#x2019;s shirts read, &#x201c;My son wants to be a doctor,&#x201d; and &#x201c;My daughter is very musical.&#x201d;<br><br> Van Es photographed Harnage as he was leaning down to grab Dr. Thiet-Tan Nguyen, a young military doctor who would become an anesthesiologist in Southern California. Next he grabbed Dr. Tong Huyhn, who would practice family medicine in a suburb of Atlanta. Next came Tuyet-Dong Bui, a slender teenage girl who will call herself Janet at the California university where she will earn a degree in micro�biology before becoming a biotech researcher. Hours before, a stray bullet had killed one of her high school classmates, and her mother had urged her to leave. Her brother, who stood a rung below her, had traded his motorbike to the chauffeur of a high-ranking military offi�cer in exchange for being led here. Standing below him was a Polgar VIP, Minister of Defense Tran Van Don, who had recently told South Vietnamese troops, &#x201c;In the coming hours, in the coming days, I will be by your side.&#x201d;<br><br> Elevator shafts like the one at 22 Gia Long Street usually have a rudimentary iron or wood ladder so mechanics can climb up and ser�vice their machinery. Yet no one seeing the Van Es photograph appears to have asked why such a large and sturdy staircase happened to be leading to the top of the elevator shaft&#x2014;in effect, leading nowhere. It was there because on April 6 Marine Corps colonel Al Gray had flown over downtown Saigon in a helicopter, surveying the roofs of buildings leased by U.S. government agencies. Air America pilots Marius Burke and Nikki Fillipi had then inspected the roofs that Gray believed capable of supporting a helicopter, gauging their strength and checking for obstructions. After choosing the thirteen most promis�ing ones, they had supervised a crew of American contractors who rerouted electrical and telephone cables and removed flagpoles and washing lines. The contractors custom built two staircases for 22 Gia Long Street: a short one leading from the main roof to an intermediate platform, and a longer one connecting that platform to the top of the elevator shaft. Their staircases had handrails and short steps so that children and the disabled could climb them.<br><br> Major General Homer Smith, the U.S. defense attach� and senior military officer in South Vietnam, approved Burke and Fillipi&#x2019;s prepa�rations, but Ambassador Graham Martin was furious when he learned about their makeshift helipads. He believed that any indication that the United States was preparing an evacuation would demoralize South Vietnam&#x2019;s military, undermine the government of President Nguyen Van Thieu, and lead to revenge attacks on American civilians. He refused Burke&#x2019;s request to pre-position barrels of fuel on the roofs, park helicopters on them overnight, and paint an <i>H </i>in green Day-Glo paint on them that matched the dimensions of a Huey&#x2019;s skids so that Air America pilots could see which ones had been converted to heli�pads and where to align their skids to ensure a 360-degree clearance. Martin argued that the <i>H </i>might alarm the Vietnamese washerwomen who dried laundry on the roofs. On his own building&#x2019;s roof, Burke painted the outline of an <i>H </i>in green dots that he later connected. Other Air America pilots ignored Martin and painted a green <i>H </i>on other helipads. <br><br> Bob Caron and Jack Hunter piloted the helicopter that landed on 22 Gia Long Street. They were among the thirty-one middle-aged Air America pilots who had volunteered to make these hazardous flights. Before Harnage recruited them to rescue Polgar&#x2019;s VIPs, they had been setting down wherever they saw people standing on a roof with an <i>H</i>. Caron was a West Point graduate and Vietnam War veteran who, like Harnage, did not give a hoot if the people he collected from these roofs were high or low priority, government ministers or their chauf�feurs. He was rescuing them, he said, &#x201c;to preserve America&#x2019;s honor.&#x201d; By the time Van Es took his iconic photograph, Caron and Hunter had made three pickups from Gia Long Street. Each time they lifted off, Caron shouted to the people being left behind on the stairs, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll make as many runs as we can!&#x201d; <br><br> A Huey could carry twelve combat-loaded American soldiers, but because Vietnamese are smaller and many of the evacuees were women and children, Harnage packed twenty people onto every flight. To make more room, he rode outside, standing on a skid while holding a Swedish machine gun in one hand. A passenger gripped his other arm to prevent him from falling to his death in case he was hit by ground fire from North Vietnamese troops or disgruntled South Vietnamese soldiers. (Earlier that day, while stopping at Tan Son Nhut to transfer his passengers onto one of the larger Marine Corps helicopters that were shuttling out to the U.S. fleet, Caron had noticed a bullet hole in his drive shaft.) Harnage had suffered wounds on Okinawa while fighting for his country and his comrades; on April 29, he was risk�ing his life to turn a few more Vietnamese strangers into American citizens.<br><br> Van Es had captured Caron&#x2019;s last pickup from Gia Long Street. Caron was almost out of gas and would have to fly half an hour out to the U.S. Navy fleet to refuel. As he lifted off for the last time, he met the eyes of those he was leaving behind&#x2014;people who were unlikely to become doctors, musicians, biotech researchers, or anything else in the United States and might instead be among the hundreds of thousands of &#x201c;class enemies&#x201d; that the Communists would send to a gulag of &#x201c;reeducation&#x201d; camps. Some would be incarcerated for as long as seventeen years, unless they died first from malnutrition, disease, hard labor, and mistreatment. It was in their eyes, Caron thought, that &#x201c;you could see they knew we were never coming back.&#x201d; Harnage never forgot their &#x201c;pleading eyes&#x201d; and would remember his last flight from Gia Long Street as a &#x201c;nightmare&#x201d; of people &#x201c;waiting on a ladder for a helicopter that does not return.&#x201d; All across Saigon on April 29, Ameri�cans avoided Vietnamese eyes. As a group walked down a boulevard toward an evacuation bus, passing Vietnamese watching silently from the doorways of their homes and shops, one man kept saying, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look in their eyes. . . . Don&#x2019;t look in their eyes. . . . Don&#x2019;t look in their eyes.&#x201d; A reporter who had refused to help her Vietnamese translator and his family escape, telling herself they would be &#x201c;better off&#x201d; in Sai�gon, never forgot &#x201c;the look of supplication in the eyes of his wife and children.&#x201d; Decades later, an American diplomat remained haunted by &#x201c;the look in the eyes of those I had to leave behind.&#x201d;<br><br> As Caron&#x2019;s helicopter lifted off, a passenger noticed her teenage son standing on the stairs and burst into tears. Tuyet-Dong &#x201c;Janet&#x201d; Bui had been excited to take her first helicopter ride, but as Saigon slipped away, she thought, &#x201c;Oh my God, I don&#x2019;t know where I&#x2019;m going. I don&#x2019;t know anybody. Where are my parents?&#x201d; and began weeping. She and the other passengers were, in their way, as courageous as Caron and Har�nage. They were leaving behind friends, family, country, and culture to become exiles in a nation where, according to a recent poll, two-thirds of its citizens did not want them. On the same day that Harnage&#x2019;s evac�uees were flying over Saigon, U.S. senator George McGovern, who had run for president in 1972 on an antiwar platform, was telling reporters in Ohio, &#x201c;I am opposed to large numbers of Vietnamese coming, not only because I think it is not in our interests. I don&#x2019;t think it is in their interest. I think the Vietnamese are better off in Vietnam, including the orphans.&#x201d; <br><br> Harnage looked down from the skids of Caron&#x2019;s helicopter and saw smoke: puffs of smoke rising from backyards where South Viet�namese were burning photographs, documents, and anything else con�necting them to the United States or the Thieu government; plumes of it spiraling from the American embassy as diplomats fed files into a rooftop incinerator; black clouds of it billowing from oil tanks and warehouses along the docks; and more smoke marking the bridges and boulevards where some South Vietnamese soldiers were mounting a brave resistance so that politicians like Tran Van Don could escape on helicopters like this one. <br><br> Caron&#x2019;s helicopter joined dozens of others stitching a patchwork of contrails across the sky. Helicopters had become symbolic of the Vietnam War, and their whomp-whomp-whomping was its descant. They flew troops into battle, rescued the wounded, retrieved the dead, and brought journalists and generals back to Saigon for clean sheets and French restaurants. Before Senator Robert F. Kennedy opposed the Vietnam War, he had told a reporter that the United States would win it because it had helicopters. &#x201c;We have them,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;the French did not.&#x201d; Instead, America&#x2019;s first helicopter war would become its first lost war, one ending with the largest helicopter evacuation in military history.<br><br> The passengers on Harnage&#x2019;s last run were among the 1,000 evacu�ees whom Air America pilots extracted from rooftops and paddies on April 29. Between noon and 5:00 a.m. the next day, U.S. military and civilian helicopters airlifted 1,373 Americans and 5,595 South Viet�namese and third-country nationals to the U.S. fleet. Add them to the 45,000 South Vietnamese and third-country nationals that U.S. Air Force transports had evacuated during the month of April, the 73,000 South Vietnamese that the U.S. Navy rescued at sea, the 2,000 Vietnamese airmen and their families who escaped to Thailand, and the others who had already left on Air America fixed-wing planes and so-called black flights, and you have more than 130,000 South Vietnamese refugees whom the U.S. government and military would process through transit camps in the Philippines, Wake Island, and Guam before flying them to relocation camps on the U.S. mainland. It would be the greatest evacuation under wartime conditions since Dunkirk and the largest humanitarian operation in American history, although at the time few Americans recognized or celebrated it as such. It occurred largely because U.S. military personnel, government employees, and private citizens staged a spontaneous, uncoordinated, and clandestine mutiny against the policies and inaction of senior U.S. officials in Saigon and Washington, and against the wishes and preju�dices of a majority of Americans and their elected representatives in Congress, risking their careers and lives to evacuate South Vietnamese who they believed were facing years of incarceration or worse under a Communist regime.<br><br> Jackie Bong, the widow of a South Vietnamese politician assas�sinated by the Vietcong, later compared the Americans who spirited her out of Saigon to the Righteous Gentiles of the Holocaust, men like Raoul Wallenberg and Oskar Schindler. The wife of a U.S. Foreign Service officer arranged to have Bong and her children collected in a car with diplomatic plates. As they neared the airport, their chauf�feur pulled in to a villa that American diplomats were using as a safe house for stashing their Vietnamese evacuees. Bong and her children were hustled into a large black sedan flying an American flag from one bumper and a South Vietnamese flag from the other. Jim Eckes, a longtime American resident of Saigon who managed a charter airline, sat in front next to the driver. Bong and her children climbed into the backseat to join Pat Barnett, an American in his late thirties whom Eckes introduced as &#x201c;your husband.&#x201d; President Thieu had ordered the MPs and national police manning the gate at Tan Son Nhut airport to arrest South Vietnamese attempting to leave without passports and exit visas. Eckes explained that they would bluff their way through by having her pretend to be ...</p><h2>The Railway Journey: Trains and Travel in the 19th Century</h2><p>Fascinating look at the development of train travel in the 19th century, especially the stress it placed on individuals and communities.

Edgerton is professor of anthropology and psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles.An anthropologist documents and details the century-long conflict between the British and the Asante of Ghana. Between 1807 and 1900, the Asante army waged a host of large-scale battles and small skirmishes against the British occupiers in a fierce struggle to resist conquest and colonization. Despite the technical superiority of the British forces, the Asante fought bravely and tenaciously, becoming the only West African army to soundly defeat a European army on multiple occasions over a lengthy period of time. Edgerton examines the roots and the evolution of the hostilities, providing a cogent analysis of the wide social, cultural, and economic gulf that separated these two proud nations. Especially worthy of note are the illuminating facts testifying to the sophisticated nature of the Asante empire and the comprehensive outlines of the hotly contested military campaigns. Framed from the Asante point of view, this treatise provides a fascinating overview of a largely neglected episode in the European colonization of Africa. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i></p><h2>The Sentence is Death</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>The Plight of Man And the Power of God: Romans 1</h2><p><p><em>"We must rouse ourselves and realize afresh that though our Gospel is timeless and changeless, it nevertheless is always contemporary.

Prelude to Terror reveals the history of a corrupt group of spymasters&#x2014;led by Ted Shackley&#x2014;who were fired when Jimmy Carter became president, but who maintained their intelligence portfolio and used it to create a private intelligence network. After this rogue group helped engineer Carter&#x2019;s defeat in 1980 and allied with George H.W. Bush, these former CIA men planned and conducted what became the Iran&#x2013;Contra scandal and, through the Saudis, allied the U.S. with extreme elements in Islam. The CIA&#x2019;s number-one front man, Edwin P. Wilson, was framed by Shackley and his cohorts so that Wilson&#x2019;s operations could be taken over. For the first time the story of how CIA director George H. W. Bush was recruited into this network, and brought it into the bosom of the Saudi royal family, is told in detail, as well as how this group&#x2019;s manipulation of the CIA bureaucracy allowed Osama bin Laden&#x2019;s fundraising to thrive as al Qaeda flourished under Saudi and CIA protection.</p><p></p><h2>The Seven Festivals of the Messiah</h2><p>One of the most fascinating, yet probably one of the least understood, topics in the Bible is that of the feasts listed in Leviticus.

Author Dr. Harold Lindsell answers in the affirmative-Yes, It Is! Discussing the meaning of special revelation and inspiration, Lindsell shows the Scripture&#39;s witness to itself and the historical view of inspiration and its implication. The basic fact is that a view of &#34;limited inerrancy&#34; has crept into evangelical Christianity. The basic problem is that a view of limited inerrancy invariably leads to concessions in matters of faith and practice. The basic need is for the church to be aware of the problem and to articulate her belief in Biblical inerrancy without fear and without compromise. Dr. Harold Lindsell leaves no doubt that the battle has been joined.</p><p>Harold Lindsell, Ph.D., D.D., (1913-1998), served as editor of Christianity Today for more than a decade. Prior to that, Dr. Lindsell taught at Columbia International University, Northern Baptist Seminary, Wheaton College, and Fuller Theological Seminary, where he also served as Dean and Vice President. He has authored more than fifteen books, including the NRSV Harper Study Bible.</p><h2>Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories for Late at Night</h2><p>According to the American College Dictionary, terror &#34;implies an intense fear which is somewhat prolonged and may refer to imagined or future dangers.&#34; When Alfred Hitchcock chooses stories to arouse terror, he is meticulously faithful to this definition. Does a haunted house frighten you? A contest between a man and a rat? Possession? Witchcraft? Does your blood chill when you think of someone being deliberately driven mad? How about a man who becomes half man, half fly? How about a tree that screams when you cut it down? Or a room that shrieks when no one is in it? Alfred Hitchcock has chosen twenty-one stories, two novelettes and a complete novel guaranteed to terrify most normal people and even some abnormal ones. As everyone knows, he is a specialist in the macabre and bizarre. Asked to explain his approach to fictional crime, he wrote: &#34;The blunt instrument, the gang murder, the paid assassin have always seemed to me positively indelicate. Murder is a fine art and needs the embellishment of a sophisticated imagination. The true aficionado prefers to have his nerves ruffled by the implied threat -- the Borgias rather than the Syndicate. What is more delightful than a domestic crime, when it is executed with subtlety and imagination? I leave to other more pedestrian talents materials based on newspaper accounts. True crimes, ugh! Alas, most of them are dull and give no evidence of the careful planning and loving thought that should go into any human activity as rewarding as murder.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Personal Pleasures</h2><p>Rose Macaulay was one of the most popular satirical novelists of her day. In this lively, anecdotal collection, she turns her admittedly opinionated attention to life&#39;s random, and largely unrecorded, pleasures. From as-tronomy to new cars, church-going to the turtles in Hyde Park, she never fails to delight and amuse with her sure philosophical sense, sharp wit, and unerring eye for life&#39;s subtle ironies. &#34;How true it is that every pleasure has also its reverse side, in brief, its pain. Therefore, I have added to most of my pleasures the little flavor of bitterness, the flaw in their perfec-tions ...which tang their sweetness and remind us of their mortality and our own, and that nothing in this world is perfect.&#34;</p><p>Emilie Rose Macaulay (1881-1958) was born in Rugby, Warwickshire but spent her early childhood in Italy. She was educated at Oxford High School for Girls and Somerville College, Oxford, where she read Modern History. She wrote her first novel, Abbots Verney, in 1906, while living in Great Shelford, near Cambridge. Rose became an ardent Anglo-Catholic and, through her great childhood friendship with Rupert Brooks, was introduced to London literary society. After moving to London, in 1914 published her first book of poetry, The Two Blind Countries. In 1918 she met the novelist and former Catholic priest Gerald O&#39;Donovan, the married man with whom she was to have an affair lasting until his death. Her final and most famous novel, The Towers of Trebizond (1956), was awarded a James Tait Black Memorial Prize and became a bestseller in America. Rose Macaulay was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire in 1958, but seven months later suffered a heart attack and died at her home.</p><h2>Rogue Warrior: Seal Force Alpha- From Vietnam&#39;s Phoenix Program to Central America&#39;s Drug Wars</h2><p>The Rogue Warrior and SEAL Force Alpha embark on a mission to foil a plot by the Chinese government and the White House to turn the United States into a third world country</p><p><b>Richard Marcinko</b> retired from the Navy as a full commander after more than thirty years of service. He currently lives in the Washington, D.C., area, where he is CEO of SOS Temps Inc., his private security firm whose clients are governments and corporations, and Richard Marcinko Inc., a motivational training and team-building company.

Once there, he'd crack a hatch, depressurize, then lower the C-130's ramp. That was so we could jump at twenty-nine thousand five hundred -- the minimum height we'd need to carry us to within striking distance of our target.<br>I was so preoccupied with checking the cargo straps on the assault craft (it was tied down astride the double-tracked rollers) that I got caught pants-down inattentive when Arch turned the interior lights off. He did that for a perfectly good tactical reason: so no one would be able to see anything untoward from the western shore of Borneo, five and a half miles below, just in case anybody happened to be looking in our direction, which was, of course, up.<br>So, I was blindsided (literally) by the sudden blackout. Then Arch the fucking pilot did something else I hadn't remembered he was going to do (although he'd told it to me in simple declarative sentences during the preflight briefing): he banked sharply to starboard as he brought the plane onto a due north heading. Surprise. Doom on Dickie. Which is a polite way of saying in Vietnamese that I was being fuckee-fuckeed. One second I was checking the quick release harness on the ICRRC, an acronym that stands for Improved Combat Rubber Raiding Craft for those of you who aren't familiar with SpecWarspeak. The next, I'd lost sight of everything and everybody else as the plane's interior went completely lightless. It was like, <i>WTF?</i><br>Then he plunged the nose earthward, dropped the right wing about forty-five degrees, and knocked me completely off balance. I rolled around in the dark like a fucking pinball SEAL, caromed off a bulkhead, got turned around the wrong way (is there any right way in these situations?), tripped over the rollers, lost my balance, and went skidding face first into one of the hard-cast, H-shaped, reinforced aluminum mounting beams that support the plane's forward seating module. It was like, <i>slip, s-l-i-d-e, SMACK -- whaap.</i><br>Oh, that <i>smarted.</i> Belay that. It fucking <i>hurt.</i> Instant agony. My oxygen mask was knocked askew. My goggles were spun halfway round my head. My helmet strap cut off my air. Now, those of you who know me at all, know that I have a unique relationship with pain. In actual point of fact, I have an existential relationship with pain. By this, I mean that I see pain not as a vague, generalized physiological concept to be explored; not as a cryptic, enigmatic problem to be analyzed; but as a real-time, essential, individual challenge; a subjective, personal confrontational <i>experience.</i><br>Pain is an ordeal; a physical encounter to be lived through, relished, and explored, <i>crack</i> by <i>smack</i> by <i>whaap.</i> My pain exists so I can demonstrate to you, my constant and gentle readers out there, that I am inexorably...alive.<br>Which is probably why that precise, painful, and even Heideggerian instant was exactly the second the C-130's crew chief -- who was waiting for his cue -- received said signal from the pilot and cracked open the port side hatch. I heard a Perot-size giant sucking sound, and felt the accompanying tremor as the Hercules lost pressure and its interior temperature dropped about 106 degrees in four and a half seconds. Oh, fuck me very much one more time! Was I ever inexorably, existentially, alive.<br>I struggled to readjust my helmet, mask, and goggles, but the environment wasn't making things easy for me. One problem: it was dark, remember? Another problem: I was wearing a shitload of equipment, and it was difficult to move quickly since I kept catching my straps, loops, lashes, or laces on one of the 130's numerous interior hooks, hangers, pylons, or braces every time I tried to shift my body position.<br>You do not, after all, jump out of an aircraft at twenty-nine point five thousand feet to go kill bad guys wearing nothing but skivvies, sneakers, and a K-Bar knife. Everything you plan to use, you must carry with you. And when your operational plan calls for a thirty-mile parachute ride followed by a ten-to-fifteen-mile boat ride, followed by who-the-hell-knows-what, you have to carry enough for contingencies. Contingencies, hell -- there's the omnipresent Mr. Murphy to worry about, so you have to go out of the plane loaded down with more junk than you'll find in the Brigade fucking Quartermaster catalog. And things get even more knotty, intricate, complex, when you are operating, like I am, in the black. (No pun intended. What I'm talking about right now are black -- as in untraceable -- ops.)<br>Which is why I wore a wet suit (generic, French-made) covered by your basic black Nomex flight coveralls (German manufacture). Over those sat a UDT-style life vest (also in basic black), as well as a Brit Royal Marine CQC (that's Close Quarters Combat) vest equipped with class-III body armor and a flotation bladder, not to mention pockets that held twenty or so pounds of lethal goodies that ran the gamut from plastique (in this case an RDX-rich Czech Semtex) and Bulgarian pencil detonators to a point-and-shoot digital electronic camera, (it produces bits-and-bytes computer images on a three-and-a-half-inch disk ratherthan using conventional film), and half a dozen extra magazines for my pistol, each of which contained vintage East German-manufactured frangible Plus-P load ammo.<br>From the starboard side of the padded pistol belt around my waist was suspended the ever-fashionable ballistic nylon tactical thigh holster containing a Portuguese knockoff of a Heckler &amp; Koch USP 9mm semiauto pistol. The compartment usually reserved for a spare magazine held a suppressor for the pistol. Suspended from my waist's port side and cinched around my left thigh sat a ballistic nylon mag-holder for six thirty-round magazines (filled with the same Kraut ammo that was inside my pistol mags), so I could reload the suppressed HK MP5-PDW I would be carrying. My belt also held a canteen of water, a pouch holding a pair of small but powerful bolt cutters (British), my first-aid kit (also French), and a K-Bar assault knife in a Kydex sheath. I've already told you about the oxygen mask (Japanese) and helmet (Israeli). I don't think I mentioned the O2 bottle, navigational chest-pack, and radio.<br>My normal weight is in the 220-pound area. If there'd been a scale on this flight, I'd have weighed somewhere in the 270 range. And I wasn't even three-quarters loaded up yet. The point of all this inventory description is to illustrate that there were a lot of possibilities when it came to the "materials that catch on protuberances" category.<br>I noticed that my fingers were going numb under the Nomex gloves. Now, I don't care whether you've jumped from thirty thousand feet once, or whether you've done it a couple of hundred times like I have: when they depressurize the fucking plane, it gets real goddamn cold, real goddamn fast. Even with the coveralls and the quarter-inch-thick neoprene foam wet suits below 'em, we were suddenly in a d-d-d-deep freeze.<br>I could sense my guaranteed fog-proof Bolle combat goggles frosting over on the outside, which would have made it hard to see the O2 connector in front of my nose -- if I could have seen anything in the blackness. I stumbled through the plane until I found an oxygen outlet. I identified it by Braille, fondled the nozzle, shoved it <i>sans</i> foreplay into the female connector, and (unlike the president) inhaled as deeply as I could.<br>Nothing happened. I sucked again. Nada. I tried a third time. <i>Bupkis.</i> This particular oxygen outlet wasn't working. But no O2 at thirty thousand feet is a course of action frowned upon in every one of the military's field manuals and instructional course materials -- not to mention the long list of personal do's and don'ts I carry in my Slovak brain.<br>So I fought my way aft in the darkness, found a second nozzle, and rapid-switched. Of course, <i>that</i> one was screwed up too. It was right then I realized that my old and constantly consistent nemesis, Mr. Murphy of Murphy's Law fame, had stowed away for the ride.<br>I yanked the tube connector out of the plane's oxygen supply and shoved it into the O2 bottle strapped to my chest along with the altimeter, compass, large digital readout watch, Magellan GPS module, and secure radio. I inhaled, and was rewarded with a lungful of oxygen. At least I'd be breathing when we went off the ramp. Of course, after that, things might get sticky. There were twenty minutes' worth of air in the bottle strapped to my chest. We were jumping at twenty-nine-thou five hundred. The estimated descent rate given the air temperature, crosswinds, humidity, and load, was eighteen feet per second. You need oxygen until you pass below ten thousand feet. Well -- this was combat, and in combat we might get away with a twelve thou ceiling.<br>Okay, <i>you</i> do the math. Twenty-nine five thou minus twelve thou, divided by eighteen feet per second, gives us approx 972 seconds (I'm talking fast because I'm using up oxygen) which, divided by sixty, comes to just over sixteen minutes of air. So if we jumped in the next three minutes, I'd be hunky-dory. If not? Sayonara, Dickie -- it would be hypoxia city.<br>You say you don't know about hypoxia? Well, lemme explain. The condition is a manifestation of pulmonary insufficiency. That's a twenty-dollar way of saying that your blood ain't gettin' enough oxygen. The manifestations include cerebral vasodilation, and changes in sensorum ranging from confusion to narcosis. In the kind of two-bit plain English I understand, this polysyllabic souffl� means that if I jump from too high an altitude I don't get enough oxygen in my brain (that's the cerebral vasodilation stuff), and I can also experience (here come the sensorum goodies): confusion, drowsiness, sluggish reaction time, loss of muscle control, blurred vision and a confused, almost drunken thought process. Bottom line -- if something goes wrong, I can kill myself because my reaction time and sensory perception mechanisms will be off-kilter. Not a favorable condition for the old Rogue Warrior to be in.<br>Arch turned the emergency lights in the cargo bay on, and everything was all of a sudden bathed in dim red. Now I could see again. There were eight of us making the jump tonight, a HAHO -- that's High Altitude, High Opening -- insertion, which would take us on that aforementioned thirty-mile airborne parasail, followed by the ten-mile boat ride. And all that -- <i>that</i> was going to be the easy part. Because after our half-the-fun-is-getting-there fun, we'd have the second part of the good time. To wit: assaulting a ship whose crew was augmented by <i>zhongdui</i> -- Chinese naval commando reconnaissance units -- who were, the intelligence reports surmised, probably almost as well trained as we were. <i>Zhongdui</i> notwithstanding, we'd take the ship down and send it to the bottom before they could get any message to the outside world that they'd been attacked.<br>Not that executing any of the above would be a problem. Not with the merry band of hop-and-pop shoot-and-looters I had with me tonight. Tonight, I was traveling with <i>Warriors.</i> Over there, Duck Foot Dewey ran a second swipe of Russian duct tape around his magazine pouch so it wouldn't come open midair and leave him <i>sans</i> ammo for the suppressed HK submachine gun secured to his chest. Just to his left, Gator Shepard checked the tape that wound around the tops of his Adidas GSG-9 tactical boots. The shock of jumping out of a plane can rip your boots right off. That's not a good idea when the outside temperature's about fifty below zero, Fahrenheit. Lose your bootie like that and you get to play "This Little Piggy Froze Solid."<br>Next to Gator, Half Pint Harris fondled his swim buddy Piccolo Mead's rucksack, pulling on it hard to make sure it wouldn't separate when the chute opened. Hunkered down just across the aisle from Half Pint was Chief Gunner's Mate Eddie DiCarlo -- I call him Nod, as in Wynken and Blynken -- taking a long and loving last look at his suppressed Heckler &amp; Koch MP5-PDW before he stowed it in the padded scabbard that would ride on his right thigh. Leaning against the bulkhead just aft of Nod was Master Chief Nasty Nicky Grundle, whom I'd rescued not three weeks ago from a drab training assignment in Hawaii. Nasty's web gear was being checked over carefully by his new swim buddy, a former UCLA linebacker named Boomerang, the only West Coast surfer-puke in my current group of shooters.<br>Boomerang (he pronounces it "Boom-rang") had earned his nickname during BUD/S. Had he ever. The first time he went through training, he broke his ankle the fifth week. So they held him back until the next cycle. The second time around, he broke his collarbone at the end of the sixth week. This time they tried to wash him out. But the sonofabitch refused to go. He kept coming back for more. And the third time through, he graduated at the top of his BUD/S class -- with two broken toes and a cracked rib.<br>I'd tell you more about Boomerang, but I see that Arch the pilot just blinked the red lights three times. And that whining noise you hear? That's the sound of hydraulics. The sonofabitch is lowering the ramp. And over there, the crewmen are unfolding the tracks so the ICRRC package -- specifically the Kevlar-reinforeed rubber assault craft, engine, fuel bladder, communications package, and assault gear, all lashed together in one ingenious, parachutable bundle -- can roll right off the end of the ramp.<br>Arch blinked the lights thrice again. That was the get-ready sign. The next signal -- the green jump indicator -- would be roughly five minutes from now.<br>Shit -- I wasn't ready to go-go-go yet. That was on the one hand. On the other hand, there was that old Rogue Commandment that had to be observed. You know the one. It goes, "Thou hast not to like it -- thou hast just to do it."<br>And, there was much "it" to do. So, I scampered up to the cockpit, gave Arch a thump on the shoulder, a hearty "fuck you, cockbreath," and an upraised middle finger to show how much I cared.<br>Arch handed the controls to his copilot and swiveled in his chair. "Fuck you, too, asshole," he said through his mask. I could see the smile in his cobra's eyes. "Just stay in one piece, huh?"<br>I nodded. "I'll try."<br>He extended his big, gloved hand. "If there's ever anything else I can do -- just call. I'm in the book at Kadena -- there are lots of Kellys, but only one, spelled my way, with an <i>ie."</i><br>"How come?"<br>"We come from the Cuban Kiellys. Grandpa was a Rough Rider who stayed behind. Over the years, the spelling got changed."<br>I grinned behind my mask, took his hand and clasped it. "Well, Kelly with an <i>i</i> and an <i>e,</i> don't make any fucking offers you don't mean."<br>His eyes grew serious. "I never do." Arch swiveled, settled back behind the wheel, made sure he had his feet firmly on the pedals, then nodded to his copilot that he was assuming control.<br>I plugged my Magellan into the navigator's satellite data display. His radar had our target ship on the screen. It was some 125-odd miles from our current position, traveling due north at a steady six knots an hour.<br>What was our current position? Well, we were over water now -- the South China Sea to be precise -- west-northwest of Belitung Island, about 200 miles south of the equator, and 110 degrees east longitude. FYI, we'd flown out of Guam eleven-plus hours ago on this here MC-130E Combat Talon aircraft, which had been custom painted for us in a dull, black radar-defeating stealth paint. The craft itself bore no identifying markings whatsoever. Neither did anyone in crew. Even so, I can tell you (don't breathe a word of this, okay?) th...</p><h2>Quiet Talks on Prayer</h2><p>Purchase of this book includes free trial access to www.million-books.com where you can read more than a million books for free.

He joins p with us through the communication of prayer in F L 3 accomplishing certain great results. This is the � main drive of prayer. Our asking and expecting and God&#39;s doing jointly bring to pass things that otherwise would not come to pass.; Prayer changes things. This is the great fact of prayer. Yeta great many prayers are not answered. Or, to put it more accurately, a great many prayers fail utterly of accomplishing any results. Probably it is accurate to say that thousands of prayers t go up and bring nothing down. This is certainly true. Let us say it just as bluntly and plainly as it can be said. As a result many persons are saying: &#34;Well, prayer is not what you claim for it: we prayed and no answer came: nothing was changed.&#34; From all sorts of circles, and in all sorts of Ian- &#34;&#34; guage comes this statement.

And they are right, quite right. The bother is that what they say is not all there is to be said. There is yet more to be said, that is right too, and that changes the final conclusion radically. Partial truth is a very mean sort of lie. t he The prayer plan like many another has been much disturbed, and often broken.

This is the untold story of a covert submarine espionage operation against the Soviet Union during the Cold War as experienced by the Commanding Officer of an active submarine. Few individuals outside the intelligence and submarine communities knew anything about these top-secret missions. Cloaking itself in virtual invisibility to avoid detection, the <i>USS Blackfin </i>went sub vs. sub deep within Soviet-controlled waters north of the Arctic Circle, where the risks were extraordinarily high and anything could happen <p></p></p><p>PETER SASGEN, who worked closely with the Commanding Officer on this project, is an expert on submarines. He has written both fiction and nonfiction on the subject. He lives in Florida. <p></p><p>Chapter One</p><p>A DEADLY GAME</p><p>U.S. NAVY COMMANDER Roy Hunter, captain of the USS Blackfin, heard the sibilant beat of ships' screws and, through the raised periscope, saw the masts of hull-down Soviet warships. Electronic Signals Measures (ESM) intercepts of radar and radio transmissions had confirmed the presence of several ships and ASW helicopters as well as the high-frequency polarized radar the Soviet helos employed for detecting exposed submarine periscopes and masts.</p><p>As he lowered the periscope, Hunter ordered, "Lower all masts. All ahead two-thirds. Make your depth two-five-zero feet. The officer of the deck has the conn."</p><p>Hunter announced his intention to track the contacts via passive sonar, then ordered the officer of the deck (OOD), a young lieutenant, to station the section .re-control tracking party, the team tasked with keeping tabs on a target's position. Rigged for red, the control room, with its lit up .re-control consoles and other vital instruments, had a spectral look.</p><p>"Conn, sonar; active sonar bearing one-three-zero," advised the sonar supervisor. "Frequency five kilohertz; ten-thousand-yard scale. Designate Sierra Ten."</p><p>The OOD toggled his microphone switch. "Conn, aye."</p><p>The report from sonar meant that the Soviet warships had shifted to high-powered active sonar, a sure sign they were searching for a submerged intruder.</p><p>"Officer of the deck, make your depth four-five-zero feet," ordered Hunter.</p><p>Greater depth would provide an extra layer of invisibility, like pulling a blanket over their heads. Since making sonar contact with the ships, Hunter had been thinking, Avoid counterdetection. In other words, don't let the Soviets know you're there. If they do, you lose. Hunter was confident he could give them the slip&#x2014; unless they got lucky, and so far it didn't seem likely.</p><p>The Soviets relied on a rigid and highly codified ASW doctrine, what they called the "struggle against submarines." It was more a theory than a proven tactic. The Sovs, with their inferior passive sonar, often gave up searching for submerged U.S. subs simply because they were too quiet to detect. Yet when using active sonar they often regarded submerged contacts as anomalies caused by scatter or thermal gradients, or reverberations caused by shallow water. Moving west, the Sov ASW team's active sonar slowly started fading. So far so good. It seemed as if they'd lost the scent . . .</p><p>"Conn, sonar; picked up a three-hundred-hertz tone. Bearing two-nine-zero, drawing right, designated Sierra Eleven. Classified as a submerged Type II." Sonar had a submerged Russian submarine contact, perhaps a Charlie or Victor nuclear attack sub.</p><p>Hunter's submarine, moving silently, was nothing more than a hole in the ocean. Not so the Soviet sub.</p><p>"Come left to two-nine-zero," the OOD ordered.</p><p>The helmsman confirmed the order; the American sub turned northwest.</p><p>A moment later the OOD ordered, "Attention in the attack center. We'll maneuver to solve the target's course, speed, and range." Turning to Hunter, he asked, "Captain, should I try to get lined up for an ASPL?"</p><p>"Not yet."</p><p>Making absolute sound pressure level recordings of a Soviet submarine's noise levels was high on Holystone's intelligence-gathering list. First, though, Hunter had to determine what this one was up to and whether the contact intended to maintain the steady course and speed essential to making accurate ASPL recordings.</p><p>"Conn, sonar. Based on the tonal upshift, the range rate is a hundred yards per minute and closing."</p><p>"Conn, aye."</p><p>Hunter settled down to wait. After several minutes the OOD ordered, "Come right to course zero-two-zero."</p><p>"I have Sierra Eleven on course zero-one-zero," reported the .re-control coordinator. "Speed ten, range forty-one hundred yards." A touch over two miles. "Got a good solution on him for an ASPL&#x2014;"</p><p>"Conn, sonar!" The sonar supervisor broke in on .re control; the urgency in his voice was unmistakable. "Heard a transient, a thump, from Sierra Eleven."</p><p>Hunter, his mind working like a computer, reviewed a picture of the setup in his head. He "saw" the approaching enemy sub in relation to his own sub, which he'd maneuvered to gain an advantage on the intruder. He was certain that the Soviet sub hadn't heard the maneuver, so how . . . ? It didn't matter how&#x2014;that thump could only mean one thing, that he'd opened the outer doors on his torpedo tubes&#x2014;</p><p>"Conn, sonar&#x2014;a single ping from Sierra Eleven!"</p><p>Hunter heard it, too, on the UQC underwater phone at the periscope stand, a shrill pulse of pure sound energy .red by the Soviet sub at Hunter's sub. The ping meant that the Russian had painted the Americans with active sonar, a sign he was about to fire a torpedo at them!</p><p>Before Hunter could issue orders, sonar broke in: "Torpedo in the water! Bearing three-one-two!"</p><p>Hunter didn't hesitate; instinct and training took over. "I have the conn! All ahead flank! Right full rudder! Come to course one-three-five!"</p><p>Caught by surprise, Hunter at first refused to believe what he'd heard. No Soviet sub would ever .re a torpedo at an American sub in peacetime. There were rules in the espionage game both sides were playing, and if they were violated it could start a goddamn war&#x2014;a nuclear war! His gut tightened. Everything suddenly ground to a halt. There was nothing more he could do, no way to avoid disaster. Like the watchstanders frozen at their stations, he heard the incoming whine of the torpedo's up-Doppler props, counted down the seconds to impact, and&#x2014;</p><p>Lights snapped on in the control room.</p><p>A moment later a voice boomed from a speaker: "You're sunk, Hunter."</p><p>Chagrined, Hunter and his .re-control team blinked, looked around the attack center simulator's mocked-up control room, and then exchanged glances with each other. Hunter, at the periscope stand, blew through clenched teeth. It had only been an exercise, but goddamn it! The team running the simulation had slipped one in on him.</p><p>A week of circling, weaving, chasing down multiple targets, avoiding detection, and now getting sunk had left him exhausted. Still, better to make big mistakes in the attack teacher than up in the Barents Sea where a real mistake could kill you, not just bruise your ego. In the simulator at the U.S. Navy's submarine school in New London, Connecticut, with its perfect scenario reconstruction, a guy could learn from his mistakes and live to tell about it. After all, here it was Americans against Americans. In the Barents it would be Americans against Soviets. Hunter lit a cigarette and thought of all the things that could go wrong up in the Barents Sea&#x2014;and how it would be his job to make sure they didn't.</p><p>Excerpted from STALKING THE RED BEAR by PETER SASGEN</p><p>Copyright � 2009 by Peter Sasgen</p><p>Published in March 2009 by St. Martin's Press</p><p>All rights reserved.

Every passerby was an actor; every car would magically stop for him; everything he saw was a cue from "The Producer" to help inspire the performance of a lifetime. After a manic spree around Manhattan, Zack, who is bipolar, was arrested on a subway platform and admitted to Bellevue Hospital. <br><br>So begins the story of Zack's freefall into psychosis and his desperate, poignant, often hilarious struggle to claw his way back to sanity. It's a journey that will take him from New York City back to his Kansas roots and to the one person who might be able to save him, his tough, big-hearted Midwestern mother, nicknamed the Bird, whose fierce and steadfast love is the light in Zack's dark world. <br><br>Before his odyssey is over, Zack will be tackled by guards in mental wards, run naked through cornfields, receive secret messages from the TV, befriend a former Navy Seal and his talking stuffed monkey, and see the Virgin Mary in the whorls of his own back hair. But with the Bird's help, he just might have a shot at pulling through, starting over, and maybe even meeting a partner who can love him back, bipolar and all. <br><br>Introducing an electrifying new voice, GORILLA AND THE BIRD is a raw and unforgettable account of a young man's unraveling and the relationship that saves him.</p><p>Zack McDermott has worked as a public defender for The Legal Aid Society of New York.

By allowing us to witness his lowest and most delusional moments, and the slow and tentative process of returning to the world, Zack McDermott provides a gripping portrait of a very real human battle too often ignored and misunderstood. I am better for reading this book."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Sarah Hepola, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Blackout</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Zack McDermott's portrait of a mind under assault from bi-polar illness is both fascinating and heart-breaking to observe, and he takes us into his experience with riveting intensity. But McDermott's real achievement is capturing the moving determination and steadfast love of the mother who saves him, the remarkable Bird who breaks the loneliness, quiets the fear and gives him a home worth returning to. I was so moved by this book and these people."&#x2015;<b><i><b>George Hodgman, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Bettyville</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A poignant memoir...[McDermott's] book asks us to destigmatize mental illness by familiarizing us intimately with the issue."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Los Angeles Review of Books</b></i></i></b><br><br>"McDermott brings a vivid and unsettling degree of intimacy to his descriptions of mania's onset. . . His work as a public defender grows out of a deep sense of empathy for the stigmatized and marginalized that's evident on every page.

Prince views it as his sacred duty to protect his family and guard its integrity. But what is he to do when the family's worst enemies are themselves?<br><br> Wry, perceptive and heartbreaking, <i>The Labrador Pact</i> is a cunning and original take on domestic life in all its joy and disillusionment. Matt Haig has created an improbably poignant narrator in Prince, offering a truly unique perspective on the foibles of family relationships. As Prince uses his heart and soul (and wags and barks) to keep the Hunter clan together, he finds himself confounded by the odd behavior of the humans he loves. To save his family, Prince must betray the ancient Pact of the Labradors&#x2014;a decision that may cost him everything.Matt Haig&#x2019;s writing has appeared in <i>The Guardian, The Sunday Times, The Independent</i>, and <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i>. <i>The Dead Fathers Club</i> is his American debut.

A fascinating look at the man behind the myth.</p><p><i><b>John Little </b>is considered one of the world's foremost authorities on Bruce Lee, his training methods, and philosophies. Little is the only person who has ever been authorized to review the entirety of Lee's personal notes, sketches, and reading annotations. Little's articles have appeared in every martial arts and health and fitness magazine in North America including </i>Muscle and Fitness. <i> He is the author of </i>The Warrior Within: The Philosophies of Bruce Lee<i>, and co-author of </i>Power Factor Training, The Golfer's Two-Minute Workout, <i>and </i>Static Contraction Training for Bodybuilders. <i>A native of Canada, John is an expert in the fields of martial arts, bodybuilding, and physical conditioning.</i>Decades after his death, fascination with martial arts superstar Lee continues. Editor Little and Lee's widow, Linda Lee Caldwell, contend Lee was much more than the acrobatic guy on the silver screen. He was a "philosopher . . . able to apply specific principles of his art to the broader endeavor of living life as a `real' human being." Toward that goal, Lee wrote the essays on acting, martial arts, and self-knowledge collected here. In fact, most of them touch on the quest for self-knowledge and, in conjunction with specimens of Lee's letters and poetry, enhance appreciation of the man. Specific topics range from the cerebral (e.g., "Psychology in Defense and Attack") to the practical (e.g., "How to Choose a Martial Art Instructor"), and pithy nuggets (e.g., "Truth cannot be structured or confused") are highlighted. Movie stars aren't always the deepest people around, once the conversation turns from showbiz, but Lee's writings are inspired and inspirational, of interest to his fans and to the multitudes seeking the meaning of life. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>CLINICAL GUIDELINES IN PRIMARY CARE</h2><p>From the classroom to clinical rotations and into practice, Clinical Guidelines in Primary Care is the resource that nurse practitioners and NP students reach for again and again.

A frequent contributor to <i>Archaeology, MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History, Folklore, and the Journal of American Folklore</i>, she is often interviewed on NPR, the BBC, and on the History and Learning channels.This dense but highly informative volume narrates the long pretechnological history of the use of poisons and fire in warfare. Mayor, who has published in Military History Quarterly, begins with the first legend of poisoned arrows: Hercules and his quiver of missiles tipped with the hydra's venom (probably snake venom). He and his wife also figure in an early use of an externally applied poison-the "poisoned" garments that killed them both with an inextinguishable flame may have been impregnated with saltpeter. Using their powers of observation and a sound if rule-of-thumb grasp of cause and effect, our not-so-primitive ancestors went on to set fires, throw fires and project fires (Greek fire reached its apex when flung from a ship-mounted flame thrower). They also put poison on arrowheads, in food and wine and in water supplies, tamed elephants to use as living tanks, bottled scorpions to throw over walls and knew about the problems of accidental casualties, enemy retaliation and lowering the ethical level of warfare. Mayor clearly describes how some of the poisons caused gruesome deaths, and Greek fire was essentially napalm. One antielephant weapon consisted of coating live pigs with pitch, setting them on fire and driving them at the elephants. The sheer mass of information will be daunting for the novice, particularly to one not familiar with classical mythology, but the book is otherwise absolutely absorbing, if macabre, and a formidable source on classical warfare, with bibliography, illustrations and annotations to serve further research. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Someday Is Not a Day in the Week: 10 Hacks to Make the Rest of Your Life the Best of Your Life</h2><p><p><b>"Inspired me to ask myself why and to stop postponing the forgotten dreams." &#x2015;Geneen Roth, #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Women Food and God</i> and <i>This Messy Magnificent Life</i></b><br><b></b><br><b>Full of inspirational insights and advice, lifehacks, and real-world examples,<i> Someday is Not a Day in the Week</i> is CEO Sam Horn&#x2019;s motivational guide to help readers get what they want in life today rather than "someday."</b></p><p>Are you:<br>� Working, working, working?<br>� Busy taking care of everyone but yourself?<br>� Wondering what to do with the rest of your life?<br>� Planning to do what makes you happy someday when you have more time, money, or freedom?</p><p>What if someday never happens?

Gibbons's cartoons in primary shapes and colors graphically illustrate the contents of a landfill and how to recycle various products to cut down on the need for landfills--for which space is already in short supply. Discussing paper, plastic, glass, cans, and polystyrene, the author describes how to recycle, why it's necessary, and its benefits. The top two-thirds of each page is devoted to illustrations that perfectly complement the brief text below. The book ends with a mention of the ozone layer and the limited potential for recycling polystyrene, followed by 14 facts about garbage. The plea is to make our planet a safer and healthier place to live with a habit that is fun and easy--recycling. An excellent, functional introduction. --Carole B.

Max's Ride and Max's Toys first appeared in 1979, while Max's Bath and Max's Bedtime both have a 1985 copyright. The texts for the most part read the same. The typeface has been changed from sans serif to serif. In Max's Ride, the concept words are now designed to reflect their meaning. So "down" now moves down the page and "under" dips under the line of text. Max's errant baby carriage hits a bump rather than a clothes basket. As for the illustrations, those bouncing baby bunny buns seem to have slipped south. Max is more of a dumpy pyramid shape with enormous feet and a softer contour line. The books are a bit larger and the color palette a tad lighter. Some of the facial expressions seem to give a different emotional emphasis. Purists may feel even Wells can't do better than the originals and shouldn't try. Still, more Max is better than less and Wells's special brand of deadpan humor is always welcome.AJudith Gloyer, Milwaukee Public Library<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Love Is a Choice Workbook</h2><p><p><em>Love Is a Choice Workbook</em> provides a ten-stage plan to help you find healing from the pain that created your codependency and then guides you through the plan using interactive questions, self-tests, exercises, and journaling.

By carefully observing people who gave him a certain "deja vu" feeling when he first met them, Dr. Henry Cloud made a remarkable discovery. No, he hadn't actually met these people before, but he had encountered their particular ways of handling life. And the common denominator with these individuals who practiced these "ways" was they were all successful! </p><p>They all... - Had healthy relationships - Reached their goals - Did not repeat the same mistakes - Were in control of their lives - Felt a sense of purpose </p><p>Dr. Cloud then decided to do something that was not the focus of his clinical training: investigate why successful people's lives were working, rather than trying to uncover what was broken in a person and trying to fix it. He learned that personal growth is not only about getting healthy, but also about the principles successful people invariably practice. </p><p>If you follow these nine principles, you can achieve great results in y our work, your relationships, and other areas of your life.

They reveal the five key elements of the blessing, describe the most common home situations where a blessing has been denied (one of them may be ours), and offer practical, effective methods to heal broken hearts and families.

A rare clear day reigned on the mountain outsiders call Mount McKinley. Wilcox and his three companions had savored it for the last few hours as they trudged upward on crusty, wind-carved snow. Atop the continent, Joe&#x2019;s deep-set eyes swept over the Alaska Range&#x2014; some of the tallest and most rugged peaks in North America&#x2014; reduced to so many white waves of rock and ice lapping at the mountain&#x2019;s base. But along with the grandeur there was an edge of tension. After twenty-seven days on the mountain, Wilcox knew that the window of good weather could close just as quickly as it had opened. The four men on the summit, along with the rest of their twelve-man team waiting for their turn just a couple of thousand feet below, had no time to waste.</p><p>Wilcox had been on the mountain for nearly a month, and as he approached the summit the final steps seemed insignificant when compared to the tremendous effort the team had made to get there. The sweeping panorama instilled in him a sense of gratitude. He had worked hard, but that hard work did not guarantee success; he felt lucky.</p><p>Two weather systems had been developing as Wilcox and his companions worked their way toward the summit: one to the northeast and one to the southwest. Rainclouds mustered over the Beaufort Sea, a stretch of ice-bound ocean that spans 1,200 unbroken miles between Alaska&#x2019;s North Slope and the North Pole. In those days the sea was largely devoid of human traffic, save the occasional Eskimo* hunter. The low-pressure system spun to life and grew in intensity as it marched southwest carrying potent moisture-laden winds toward the Alaska Range. At the same time an equally strong high-pressure system developed over the Aleutian Islands, a windswept, treeless archipelago, known by mariners as the Cradle of Storms, southwest of Denali. The development and location of both weather systems at that time of year was unusual.</p><p>These massive weather systems, separated by a thousand miles of forest, mountain, tundra, and taiga, were on a collision course, headed straight toward Joe Wilcox.</p><p>On the summit at an elevation of 20,320 feet, Wilcox watched wind-whipped cirrus clouds high above him. These clouds marked the margins of the two massive weather systems as they began to brush against each other. In a matter of hours one of the most violent storms ever recorded on the mountain would engulf the peak and leave seven of Joe Wilcox&#x2019;s twelve-man expedition dead.</p><p>Joe stood six foot one inch tall. He was twenty-four years old. I was five. I don&#x2019;t know why my dad took me along on the drive in his light-green Park Service sedan deep into the park that midsummer night. It might have been because I&#x2019;d been cooped up in the house by days of rain, or maybe he just wanted the company of his son. Whatever the reason, there I was, wearing my red-topped rubber boots next to Dad on the wide bench seat as we weaved along the endless muddy road deep inside Mount McKinley National Park. Two more light-green park vehicles, with rangers at the wheels, followed behind. With the sun low on the horizon it was light out, but low-hanging clouds obscured Denali and the alpine vistas that flanked the road. The small black spruce and willow trees, stunted by the high altitude and latitude, marched up the hillsides and disappeared into the mist as we passed by. The creek beds roiled with muddy, brown water from bank to bank, the result of the steady rain that had not yet stopped.</p><p>Most of the time, I loved riding shotgun with Dad. He was a gregarious man who sang while he drove, mostly military songs he learned in the Army Air Corps during World War II. When he wasn&#x2019;t singing, &#x201c;Over hill, over dale, as we hit the dusty trail . . .&#x201d; he was whistling, telling stories, pointing out landmarks and wildlife, or expounding on historical facts that were usually without much meaning to my young mind. I&#x2019;d lean against him on the seat and steer the car while he kept us on the road with his thumbs secretly pressed against the bottom of the steering wheel.</p><p>That night, he was a different man. His National Park Service&#x2013;issue tan Stetson sat between us on the seat; it rarely left the hat rack at park headquarters. I was used to being quiet, since he usually did all the talking, but this time Dad was almost as mute as I was. The air hung heavy with the absence of his chatter and gave the car a closed-in, somber feel. He whistled a little at first, but the songs trailed off, like his heart wasn&#x2019;t in it. Soon the rhythm of the windshield wipers and the slosh and ping of the muddy gravel road under our wheels was our only accompaniment.</p><p>We drove far into the park, the distance elongated by the strange silence, and finally stopped at a pullout near a rain-swollen river. Dad got out, slipped a green raincoat over his uniform, and huddled with the other men. The air was sharply cool, and carried the tang of freshly cut earth. I noticed places where the riverbank had fallen into rushing water. Bored, I walked toward the river, tossed in sticks, and watched the current sweep them away. The last time we&#x2019;d stopped here on a family outing, the river looked completely different&#x2014;a series of gravel bars laced with narrow braids of flowing water. Now it was a single channel of brown water, wider than the park road.</p><p>Dad returned to my side, but the others waited in their vehicles with engines idling and headlights shining in the rainy gloom. We ambled slowly along the swollen river. I skipped stones while Dad trailed behind, one eye on me while he scanned up and down the riverbank. He didn&#x2019;t join in the rock skipping or find flat rocks for me; I was on my own. The turbulent water made skipping difficult, so I turned my attention to bigger rocks, heaving in big clunkers to hear the satisfying thunk and the muffled, bowling-alley crashes as they careened along the rocky riverbed in the swift current.</p><p>We were nearly out of sight of the vehicles when Dad looked up and suddenly stiffened.</p><p>&#x201c;Andy, get back to the car,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Now.&#x201d; </p><p>I froze and looked at him in confusion.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t look back at me but gazed downstream. &#x201c;Go,&#x201d; he said, calmly but firmly.</p><p>I turned, took a step, and promptly tripped and fell onto the rocks. I saw blood trickle onto my palms. He moved quickly and grabbed my hand, took two strides, and then swung me ahead of him, repeating the process as we scrambled over the rocks and driftwood along the riverbank. He set me down on a sandy stretch and I ran, but I was too small to keep up, so he reached down and grabbed my hand again. I held his hand with both of mine, lifted my feet off of the ground, and ventured a look behind as he swung me ahead toward the idling cars. Far downstream, maybe a couple hundred yards, a dark, hulking shape had emerged from the brush along the river and loped toward us.</p><p>Grizzly bear, I thought. He never said the words, but I was pretty sure Dad was thinking the same thing.</p><p>Fear seized me. I&#x2019;d seen plenty of grizzly bears, but always from the safety of our car, never on foot with nothing between us but rain and wind. Children who lived in the park were warned to retreat indoors at the first sign of the big animal. Doors to the homes in the small enclave that surrounded park headquarters were not locked, and we all understood that it was OK to enter any home at any time, if necessary, to avoid wildlife. Running wasn&#x2019;t advised when encountering a bear, but we&#x2019;d also been told that when refuge is close, it&#x2019;s always wise to seek it. Dad was following that advice. Paralyzed with fear and dangling from Dad&#x2019;s grip like a rag doll, I looked backward rather than forward, watching the intruder&#x2019;s slow progress as Dad hustled us to where the others waited.</p><p>Back in the car, we watched as the dark shape shambled along the bank where we had stood minutes earlier. Just as suddenly as he had grabbed my hand and retreated, Dad relaxed, his shoulders slumping and the firm, set line of his lips upturning in relief. He opened the door and walked toward the approaching figure as it came into focus. I stayed in the backseat, still scared, even though I could see that it was no grizzly but a man wearing a huge backpack and caped by a billowing brown rain poncho.</p><p>Mountaineers were rare in those days. About twenty came to the park each year to climb, and they were enigmas to me, even more unusual than the moose and bear and sheep that frequented this two-million-acre wilderness preserve. Somehow I knew he was a climber, though he was the first one I&#x2019;d seen. He was tall and his wet clothes hung loosely on his lean frame. I peered over the dashboard to get a closer look at this rare creature, taking in his unbuttoned flannel shirt, mud-covered high-water pants, thick-knuckled fingers, and battered boots. At first I thought he was as ancient as Dad, but when he turned his head and saw me watching him, he smiled. His teeth were dazzling against his brown beard and sunburned face, and I realized he was not much older that the teenage boys who lived next door.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know what they said to each other&#x2014;I stayed in the car, watching from my perch behind the dashboard as they talked. The young man unshouldered his pack and did most of the talking, gesturing with his hands and occasionally pointing into the foggy distance. Dad and the rangers listened intently, their faces serious, rain dripping from the brims of their Stetsons. After what seemed like hours, the circle of men broke, the climber got into one of the other vehicles, and we began the long drive home, slithering and bouncing along the muddy park road.</p><p>I peppered Dad with questions about the strange man who had emerged from a wilderness that I thought was home only to moose, caribou, sheep, and bear: Who is he? Where did he come from? Why had we come all this way to meet him?</p><p>After a long silence my father said there had been a climbing accident on Denali and some boys had died. His voice was heavy and sounded tired, as if the words were difficult to pronounce. His tone told me the moment was grave, and part of me knew I should share his sadness. But I was just a kid and I was both scared and excited by the thrilling sprint along the river.</p><p>&#x201c;What happened, Daddy, did they fall off a cliff ?&#x201d; I asked. </p><p>&#x201c;There was a bad storm, kiddo. We don&#x2019;t know what happened to them yet, but we&#x2019;re trying to find out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you just fly up and get them?&#x201d; I continued. </p><p>&#x201c;We did, but the boys we found were already dead.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Are you going to bring them down?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, we&#x2019;ll probably leave them buried in the snow.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What if the snow melts?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re in snow that never melts.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p><p>THOSE WHO CAME</p><p>BEFORE</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Athabaskan people have lived in the shadow of the great mountain for ten thousand years and know it by many names. To the people of the Lower Tanana, it is Deenaadheet or Deennadhee. The Dena&#x2019;ina call it Dghelay Ka&#x2019;a; the Koyukon, Deenaali. Each tribe&#x2019;s name, though unique, translates to roughly the same meaning: the Big One, the High One, the Great One.</p><p>Neither legends nor oral tradition indicate that Alaska&#x2019;s Native people desired or attempted to climb it. Though it was revered, no taboo appears to have kept Alaska&#x2019;s indigenous people from standing on the summit. A healthy aversion to the treacheries of glacier travel and perhaps common sense were enough.</p><p>The subsistence life was hard. The icy slopes and inhospitable mountaintop held no allure to those whose lives were focused on the already-difficult challenge of surviving off the subarctic wilderness; in fact, they avoided the desolate terrain. When Alfred Brooks made the first approach to the mountain in 1902 during a US Geological Survey he knew he was the first white man to see it up close, and speculated that no Alaska Native had been so near to it either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was far beyond, where the moccasined foot of the roving Indian had never trod. The Alaska Native seldom goes beyond the limit of smooth walking and has a superstitious horror of even approaching glacial ice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>Among the world&#x2019;s high mountains, summits in excess of 20,000 feet are surprisingly common. In the South American Andes, more than forty exceed 20,000 feet in height; in the Himalayas, hundreds rise higher. But height alone does not define a mountain. While Denali is the tallest mountain in North America at 20,320 feet, it also is arguably the biggest mountain on the planet.</p><p>The Denali massif is bounded on the west by Kahiltna Pass and to the east by the Traleika Col. The Peters Glacier, at the base of the Wickersham Wall, is its northern boundary. The Ruth Gap marks its southern edge. Within those margins is Denali, a 144-square-mile mass of rock, snow, and ice that rises abruptly from a 2,000-foot plateau, soaring 18,000 feet from base to summit, the greatest vertical relief of any mountain on Earth, with the exception of the Hawaiian seamount Mauna Kea, the bulk of which lies beneath the Pacific Ocean. In comparison, Mount Everest, though 29,029 feet above sea level, rests on the 17,000-foot-high Tibetan Plateau and rises just 12,000 feet from base to summit. A similar plateau boosts the Andes; without those geologic booster seats, those peaks all would lie in Denali&#x2019;s shadow.</p><p>Denali is the apex of the Alaska Range, a cordillera that arcs 600 miles across Alaska, dividing the coastal lowlands around Cook Inlet from the Yukon lowlands of interior Alaska. The great range is about 60 miles wide near Denali and home to twenty peaks taller than 10,000 feet.</p><p>Most of the cordillera is composed of sedimentary shale, limestone, and sandstone that is between 100 and 400 million years old, but a handful of peaks&#x2014;among them Denali, Foraker, Hunter, and the Moose&#x2019;s Tooth&#x2014;arise from a younger 35-million-year-old granite intrusion. Tectonic activity continues to push the entire range upward at a rate of about one millimeter a year even as the erosive action of wind, water, and ice wear it down. The durable gray-and-pink granite ensures that millions of years from now Denali and its granite brothers will endure long after their sedimentary neighbors have been reduced to glacial dust and carried away by wind and water.</p><p>Europeans began exploring Alaska a little more than two hundred years ago and, upon seeing the mountain dominating the interior skyline, were immediately impressed by its evident size. Russian trappers were the earliest to push into the hinterlands and, like the Alaska Natives, were prosaic about the mountain, referring to it as Bolshaya Gora, or Big Mountain. British Navy captain George Vancouver made the earliest written reference to Denali in 1794 after navigating the silty shoals of Knik Arm at the head of Cook Inlet. Standing on the deck of the HMS Discovery, he looked north and noted the horizon &#x201c;bounded by distant stupendous snow mou...</p></p><h2>Draw Every Little Thing: Learn to draw more than 100 everyday items, from food to fashion (Volume 1) (Inspired Artist, 1)</h2><p><b>Learn to draw and paint more than 100 of your favorite everyday items!

More than once, they&#x2019;ve begged, &#x201c;Just tell me what to do.&#x201d;</b><p>It&#x2019;s no surprise that even my most successful friends feel confused or paralyzed. Even if they have a shelfful of personal finance books, they don&#x2019;t have time to make sense of all the information available. They don&#x2019;t just want good advice, they want the best advice&#x2014;so rather than do the &#x201c;wrong thing,&#x201d; they do nothing. Their 401(k) and bank statements pile&nbsp;up, unexamined or maybe even unopened.</p><p>What they don&#x2019;t realize is that bad calls about money aren&#x2019;t failures; they&#x2019;re just what happens when emotional creatures have to make decisions about the future with limited information. What I tell them is that we need to scrap striving for perfection and instead commit to a process of guessing and making adjustments when things go off track. Of course we&#x2019;re going to make the best guesses we can&#x2014;but we&#x2019;re not going to obsess over getting them exactly right.</p><p>The fact is, in a single page you can prioritize what you really want in life and figure out how to get there. That&#x2019;s because a great financial plan has nothing to do with what the markets are doing, what your real estate agent is pitching, or the hot stock your brother-in-law told you about.

How much do I need to invest each year, and how do I allocate it? How much life insurance do I need?&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t worry: I&#x2019;ll cover those topics and many more, sharing strategies that will take the complexity out of them.<br><br> The most important thing is getting clarity about the big picture so you can cope with the unexpected. Maybe you&#x2019;ll lose the job you thought was secure; you&#x2019;ll take a financial risk that doesn&#x2019;t pan out; you&#x2019;ll have twins when you were only budgeting for one. In other words: Life will happen.</p><p>But no matter what happens, this book will help you bridge the gap between where you are now and where you want to go.</p></p><p><b>CARL RICHARDS</b>&nbsp;is a certified financial planner and a columnist for the New York Times, where his weekly Sketch Guy column has run every Monday for over five years.

He&#x2019;s a writer&#x2014;and a successful one at that. Together with his brother Chip, he has a few <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers under his belt&#x2014;so he asked me what I was working on. I told him about two ideas I had been thinking about for books, and then, almost as an afterthought, I mentioned something I&#x2019;d had in the back of my mind for ten years. It was a book I was thinking about writing someday called <i>The One-Page Financial Plan</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d buy that,&#x201d; he replied almost immediately.</p><p>Surprised by his response, I asked him to tell me more. I was curious since I&#x2019;d only told him the title. What exactly did he think he&#x2019;d be buying? Why the sudden interest?</p><p>&#x201c;Creating a &#x2018;financial plan&#x2019; just seems so overwhelming,&#x201d; he responded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have to meet with a lawyer and a financial planner and decide what my goals are for the rest of my life, and then face the overwhelming and depressing truth about planning for retirement (it seems you need to have $7.8 million saved by age sixty-five or else get ready to eat dog food), and then pick among a thousand mutual funds, but then there is the 401(k) plan at work with these Latin American government bond funds and such, and so the only rational response is <i>not</i> to create a financial plan.&#x201d;</p><p>It doesn&#x2019;t surprise me that he would respond this way, given how inundated we are with countless choices. Even a trip to the grocery store can lead to our feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. I have a friend in New York who lives a few blocks from a fancy mayonnaise store. How many kinds of mayonnaise do we really need? (My friend admits that she&#x2019;s tried numerous flavors, and they&#x2019;re all delicious.)</p><p>Of course, things get really frustrating when the stakes are higher than what we&#x2019;re going to put on our BLTs. Take my recent experience with my dog, Zeke. He was having some stomach problems (I&#x2019;ll spare you the details of how I knew), and it was clear we needed to take him to the vet to get him checked out. I&#x2019;m probably a lot like you: busy. When Zeke got sick, my family was getting ready to leave on vacation, work was piling up, and the kids needed to be shipped back and forth between a bunch of activities.</p><p>But luckily the vet is located literally two hundred yards from my office. When I dropped him off, I told the vet I had a ton of errands to run. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t I come back in a few hours once you&#x2019;ve had plenty of time to fully check him out?&#x201d;</p><p>When I returned, the vet informed me that they had time to do a full diagnosis and they&#x2019;d run all kinds of tests.</p><p>Then she said, &#x201c;You have three options.&#x201d;</p><p>That was the moment everything fell apart.</p><p>As soon as she said &#x201c;three options,&#x201d; I felt myself start to panic. In fact, I felt like my head was about to explode.</p><p>As I tried to collect myself, she started to walk me through option one. About halfway through her description of the treatment, I couldn&#x2019;t take it anymore. I held my hands up in the air, looked her in the eyes, and said, &#x201c;Stop. Just tell me: If Zeke were your dog, what would you do?&#x201d;</p><p>She went back to walking me through the options. I stopped her again. She did it again: more options.</p><p>Finally, I put my finger to my lips and I actually shushed her. Then I said, very slowly, &#x201c;No. Really. I mean it. Stop giving me options I&#x2019;m not qualified to evaluate. Please. I&#x2019;m begging you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Just tell me what to do.&#x201d;</p><p>Most financial books and magazines and Web sites are like that vet: they give readers a long list of options that just add to their confusion. No wonder my friend had given up on coming up with a financial plan: he didn&#x2019;t even know where to start.</p><p>And he&#x2019;s not the only one. Whether I&#x2019;m eating dinner with friends or telling someone what I do, the conversation inevitably turns to how hopeless they feel about their retirement or investment plans. More than once, people have asked me the same thing I asked the vet: &#x201c;Just tell me what to do.&#x201d;</p><p>These people are smart. They&#x2019;re great at what they do. Many are total stars in their fields&#x2014;experts in business, science, and the arts&#x2014;and yet, when it comes to their own finances, they&#x2019;re stuck. They&#x2019;re often paralyzed by the fear of making the wrong decision.</p><p>It doesn&#x2019;t surprise me that my most successful friends are confused when it comes to savings and retirement. When they do something, they want to do it right. They don&#x2019;t just want good advice, they want the <i>best</i> advice. They&#x2019;ve often got a shelfful of books about investing or finance, but they simply don&#x2019;t have the time to really dive in&#x2014;so, rather than do the &#x201c;wrong thing,&#x201d; they do nothing.</p><p>Of course, it&#x2019;s not just fear of making a mistake that holds us back from taking action&#x2014;it&#x2019;s also the mistakes we&#x2019;ve already made that we don&#x2019;t want to own up to. Often, just the idea of having to open our bank statements can be stressful so we let them pile up, hoping that something will happen to change our situation. Of course, what actually needs to change is our own behavior&#x2014;but that&#x2019;s easier said than done.</p><p>There are many stories these days of people who lost their financial bearings during the housing boom and the crisis that followed&#x2014;but when I lost my own house in 2010, it was a little bit different.</p><p>I&#x2019;m a financial advisor. I get paid to help people make smart financial choices. I should have known that we couldn&#x2019;t afford a house that cost almost twice what we&#x2019;d originally set out to spend. I should have known that there was something wrong with being able to borrow 100 percent of the purchase price. I should have listened to my gut when it told me, <i>Something&#x2019;s wrong.</i></p><p>I&#x2019;m a financial advisor, and yet I never sat down to figure out what it would take to make this work. I just wanted to believe our real estate agent, despite the fact that he was making money on the deal. And it was so easy to believe he had been right, at least at first. We loved our new house. The children went to an awesome public school, and we made some great friends. I could ride my bike to Red Rocks, the wilderness area outside of town. And for a time, the real estate market erased any doubt I may have had.</p><p>It just kept going up&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. until, well, you know.</p><p>Yes, I&#x2019;m a financial advisor. But in the heat of the moment, when my income was rising rapidly, when home prices were soaring with no sign of stopping, I wasn&#x2019;t thinking like one.</p><p>Some might say I wasn&#x2019;t even thinking at all. I was just following the crowd.</p><p>After I watched my house almost triple in value and used some of that equity to start a business, the real estate market collapsed faster than almost any of us realized. Within a matter of just a few short months, we found ourselves faced with the reality that we had to move back to Utah and that we owed more than the house was worth. After working with the bank for almost a year, everybody agreed that a short sale was the best option.</p><p>As devastating as that experience was, I learned something valuable: the best financial plan has nothing to do with what the markets are doing, nothing to do with what your real estate agent is telling you, nothing to do with the hot stock your brother-in-law told you about.</p><p>It has everything to do with what&#x2019;s most important to you.</p><p>Over the last two decades, I&#x2019;ve had thousands of conversations about this topic. I&#x2019;ve worked with hundreds of clients to create customized financial plans and talked to hundreds of advisors about their best ideas and techniques. And, as I&#x2019;ll write about throughout this book, I&#x2019;ve learned from experience: I&#x2019;ve made mistakes that no rational financial advisor should make&#x2014;but, of course, I&#x2019;m not just a financial advisor, I&#x2019;m also human, and a big part of being human involves irrationality.</p><p>Irrational decisions and bad calls about money aren&#x2019;t &#x201c;failures&#x201d;; they&#x2019;re just what happens when emotional creatures have to make decisions about the future with limited information. They&#x2019;re not something to run from; they&#x2019;re something to be acknowledged, something we can learn from, and, yes, even something we can plan for. With that in mind, we&#x2019;re going to scrap any striving for perfection and instead commit to a process of guessing and making adjustments when things go off track. Of course we&#x2019;re going to make the best guesses we can&#x2014;but we&#x2019;re not going to obsess over getting them exactly right.</p><p>How important is it to get started? &#x201c;The average working household has virtually no retirement savings&#x201d; was one of the startling conclusions of a 2013 report from the National Institute on Retirement. &#x201c;When all households are included&#x2014;not just households with retirement accounts&#x2014;the median retirement account balance is $3,000 for all working-age households and $12,000 for near-retirement households. Two-thirds of working households ages fifty-five to sixty-four with at least one earner have retirement savings less than one time their annual income, which is far below what they will need to maintain their standard of living in retirement.&#x201d;1</p><p>Simply by reading this book and making some choices, you&#x2019;ll be better off than the vast majority of your neighbors.</p><p>One thing you won&#x2019;t find in this book is a silver bullet investment strategy. There&#x2019;s an entire industry built around the idea that successful financial planning requires finding the best investment: if we just look hard enough or have the right contacts, we&#x2019;ll be able to identify the next hot stock, sector, or mutual fund. However, the research is pretty clear that this strategy almost always leaves us disappointed. We simply aren&#x2019;t great at picking the next Google.</p><p>What you will find here is some advice that, at first glance, may seem out of place in a financial planning book. The first three chapters of the book help you think through the kinds of questions and conversations that typically come up when I&#x2019;m helping my clients create a customized financial plan. Some of them might seem like the kind of questions you&#x2019;d find in a self-help book, but, I assure you, this isn&#x2019;t a book full of empty promises and trademarked mantras. This is a book about answers.</p><p>But here&#x2019;s the thing: your answers shouldn&#x2019;t look anything like my answers or your neighbor&#x2019;s answers. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re going to start with some questions not simply about <i>how</i> to save and invest your money, but about <i>why</i> you&#x2019;re doing it in the first place.</p><p>I know what you want to do: skip to the chapter where I answer the question &#x201c;Where do I put my money and how much?&#x201d; Pretty much every client I&#x2019;ve ever worked with has walked into my office with an &#x201c;Okay, kid, show me what you&#x2019;ve got&#x201d; kind of attitude, and to be honest, I was tempted to write that book for you. I could write about how to pick the best stock; I could write a book on &#x201c;One stock that will change your life.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d get to be on all the shows, but I wouldn&#x2019;t be helping you. I&#x2019;d just be adding to the circus. But that&#x2019;s not why I wrote this book. My goal was to help my friend, or my mom, or the friends I&#x2019;ve had lunch with.</p><p>Am I really supposed to fit my financial plan on one page?</p><p>Not long ago, my wife and I were trying to make some really important financial decisions. We&#x2019;d already spent a lot of time on the details&#x2014;we&#x2019;d set up savings accounts, bought insurance, and come up with an investment process. But whenever we had to make a decision, we were getting bogged down in all the details. Finally, out of a sense of frustration, I wondered, &#x201c;What if I had to put it all on one page? What&#x2019;s the stuff that <i>really</i> matters?&#x201d;</p><p>I noticed a Sharpie on my desk and saw card stock in the printer, so I pulled them out and just wrote down the three or four things that were really important to us.</p><p>The first answered the question &#x201c;Why?&#x2014;Why is money really important to us?&#x201d; It served as a kind of statement of our values, something that would remind us why we were working hard and saving money.</p><p>The remaining three were specific things that we needed to do to reach our major financial goals:</p><p>1. We wanted to make sure we fully funded all our retirement accounts each year.</p><p>2. We wanted to put a certain amount of money into each of our four kids&#x2019; education funds each year.</p><p>3. All the money we saved beyond that would be set aside in an account to one day buy a house.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>Then we set it aside.</p><p>About a month went by before we found ourselves facing another big decision and having a similar conversation. Then I said, &#x201c;Wait a second. I think we&#x2019;ve already done this.&#x201d; So I went and found the one-page plan. After all, we&#x2019;d already spent the cognitive energy to make these decisions. Why go through them all again?</p><p>There&#x2019;s a couple of important things to keep in mind about your one-page plan.</p><p>No two financial plans will look the same. Yours will probably look a lot different from the one my wife and I created. That&#x2019;s the point.</p><p></p></p><h2>A Time to Plant: Southern-Style Garden Living</h2><p><p><i>Captures Southern indoor/outdoor living traditions for a new generation . . . </i></p> <p>A vital young voice in the gardening scene teaches a new generation of Southerners to love gardening and to make it a focal point of their lifestyle.

Toni Bernhard open- heartedly shares the deep pain and equally deep joy of her experience in a way that allows us to validate the pain of our own circumstances, and still find joy and contentment within any context.<br> <br>She offers simple, deeply wise practices that reduce the suffering associated with grasping for things to be other than they are by allowing us to accept and enjoy things exactly as they are, including our own desire for something else. Her willingness to step fully into her life after it&#x2019;s been dramatically narrowed by illness, and to share this process with us, inspires us each to live our own lives more fully, accepting the challenges that arise, and finding the joys inherent in each moment. Toni&#x2019;s writing feels like a good friend, helping us cultivate compassion for ourselves and those around us, as we make our way through whatever life presents to us. Her honesty in sharing her struggles and setbacks helps us be kinder to ourselves as we experience our own.

Born and raised in Newfoundland, he left high school at the age of 14 to work on fishing boats from the Grand Banks to the Bering Sea. His writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>National Geographic</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, and elsewhere; his ocean farm won the Buckminster Fuller Challenge for ecological design, and, in 2017, was named one of TIME magazine&#x2019;s Best Inventions. He is the owner of Thimble Island Ocean Farm, and Executive Director of the non-profit Greenwave, which trains new ocean farmers.I am a restorative ocean farmer. It&#x2019;s a trade both old and new, a job rooted in thousands of years of history, dating back to Roman times. I used to be a commercial fisherman, chasing your dinner on the high seas for a living, but now I farm twenty acres of saltwater, growing a mix of sea greens and shellfish. <br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve paid my debt to the sea. I dropped out of high school to fish and spent too many nights in jail. My body is beat to hell: I crawl out of bed like a lobster most mornings. I&#x2019;ve lost vision in half my right eye from a chemical splash in Alaska. I&#x2019;m an epileptic who can&#x2019;t swim, and I&#x2019;m allergic to shellfish. <br> &nbsp;<br> But every shiver of pain has been worth it. It&#x2019;s a meaningful life. I&#x2019;m proud to spend my days helping feed my community, and if all goes well, I will die on my boat one day. Maybe get a small obit in the town paper, letting friends know that I was taken by the ocean, that I died a proud farmer growing food underwater. That I wasn&#x2019;t a tree hugger but spent my days listening to and learning from waves and weather. That I believed in building a world where we can all make a living on a living planet.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fishermen must tell our own stories. Normally, you hear from us through the thrill-seeking writer, a Melville or Hemingway, trolling my culture for tall tales, or a Greenpeace expos� written from the high perch of environmentalism, or the foodie&#x2019;s fetishization of artisanal hook and line. When fishermen don&#x2019;t tell our own stories, the salt and stink of the ocean are lost: how the high seas destroy our bodies but lift our hearts, how anger and violence spawn solidarity and love. There&#x2019;s more edge to fishermen&#x2014;more swearing, more fights, more drugs&#x2014;and we are both victims and stewards of the sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> So this is my story. It&#x2019;s been a long, blustery journey to get here, but as I look back over my shoulder, a tale of ecological redemption emerges from the fog. It begins with a high school dropout pillaging the high seas for McDonald&#x2019;s and ends with a quiet ocean farmer growing sea greens and shellfish in the &#x201c;urban sea&#x201d; of Long Island Sound. It&#x2019;s a story of a Newfoundland kid forged by violence, adrenaline, and the thrill of the hunt. It&#x2019;s about the humility of being in forty-foot seas, the pride of being in the belly of a boat with thirteen others work�ing thirty-hour shifts. About a farm destroyed by two hurricanes and reborn through blue-collar innovation. It is a story of fear and love for our changing seas.<br> &nbsp;<br> But, most important, it&#x2019;s a search for a meaningful and self-directed life, one that honors the tradition of seafaring culture but brings a new approach to feeding the country among the wandering rocks of the climate crisis and inequality. As fishermen and farmers before me, all I&#x2019;ve asked for is a job that fills my chest with pride, a working life that my people can write and sing songs about.<br> &nbsp;<br> I still miss being a commercial fisherman. But that&#x2019;s over now. Overfishing, climate change, acidification have forced me to change course. Now I have more in common with a kale farmer than I do with fishermen. My life is quiet, constant&#x2014;working the same patch of ocean day after day for over a decade. I can&#x2019;t hang out in the same bars: What fish tales would I tell? Would I swagger into the Crow&#x2019;s Nest, turn up the lilt of my Newfoundland accent, order a stout, and tell a yarn about sea�weed? &#x201c;There I was in fucking flat calm. Reached down with my gaff, hooked a buoy, and up came my kelp, glistening brown wide blades. Fifteen feet. Longest I&#x2019;d seen it in years. Yes, b&#x2019;y, it was something to see.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;d be laughed out of the bar.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>About this book</b><br> Writing this book was hard. My early years are fogged with drug-fueled violence and adrenaline, and I suspect drenched in over-the-shoulder romanticism. A life seen in reverse is an untidy affair. I struggled with structure. After much wrangling, I decided to weave together five concurrent strands.<br> &nbsp;<br> First is my evolution from fisherman to ocean farmer. It was a difficult, emotional birth. I had to rewire my nervous system to new tempos of work, grow a blue thumb, hang out with odd breeds of people, even learn a new vernacular of food. It was a bumpy trip: my first brush with aquaculture left me disillu�sioned, and I&#x2019;ve made many mistakes along the way to becom�ing a restorative famer, but in the end I landed on my feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> The second strand is my rocky romance with sea greens. Like most Americans, I was skeptical about moving seaweed to the center of the dinner plate. Honestly, except for sushi, it sounded kind of gross. But I fell in love with a food lover, and she took me by the hand on a long journey of discovery. We met chefs spe�cializing in making unappetizing food beautiful and delicious, learned about the lost culinary history of Western seaweed cui�sine, and tested out kelp dishes on roofers and plumbers. In the book I&#x2019;ve included a handful of recipes developed by Brooks Headley and David Santos, two of the most creative working chefs in the United States, whose work points the way toward a delicious future.<br> &nbsp;<br> The third strand is instructional: how to start your own underwater garden. It provides the basics for building a farm, seeding kelp and shellfish, and provides tips on farm mainte�nance and harvesting. It&#x2019;s not comprehensive, of course, but it might wet your whistle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fourth is my journey of learning. I had a long history of struggling in school, but yearned for a way to understand my life on the ocean within a larger context. So I trace my learn�ing curve through the rise of industrial aquaculture and the origins of restorative ocean farming to the secret strategy to convince Americans to eat kale and the emergence of the regen�erative economy. There were many surprises along the way. Who knew that the Japanese consider an Englishwoman the birthing mother of nori farming and hold a festival in her honor every year? Or that a shipwrecked Irishman accidentally invented mussel cultivation while trying to net some birds to eat? Or that McDonald&#x2019;s pioneered a seaweed-based burger in the 1990s?<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, there is my tale of passing the baton. This didn&#x2019;t always go well. I swam with the sharks of Wall Street, drowned in viral media, and failed at building a new processing com�pany. But it was worth the trip, because out of the ashes came GreenWave, a training program for new farmers, partnerships with visionary companies like Patagonia in the era of climate change, and a new generation of ocean farmers to take over the helm and release me back to my beloved farm.<br> &nbsp;<br> You&#x2019;ll also hear a lot about kelp in the book. On my farm, we&#x2019;ve experimented with a few different kinds of seaweed, but sugar kelp has emerged as the most productive, delicious, and viable native species in my area. Most of the book will refer to kelp, but know that, every day, farmers, scientists, and chefs around the world are figuring out new ways to grow and use the thousands of vegetables in the ocean.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though I include a lot about kelp, I&#x2019;ve written very little about Asian cuisine. The history of seaweed use in East Asia is well documented, and I could never do it justice. What&#x2019;s sur�prising is the largely unknown parallel history&#x2014;reaching back thousands of years&#x2014;of shellfish and seaweed cultivation and cooking in the West. At times these two histories intersect, which I explore in the book, but I figured my job as a U.S.-based ocean farmer was to explore my own regional roots, and ways to cook and work with sea greens within the region I know.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although I&#x2019;m an ocean famer, I am not a fish farmer. The vast majority of aquaculture has entailed humans&#x2019; trying to grow animals that swim. Recently, there have been major advances in the industry, but my take&#x2014;which routinely drops me into hot water with the fish-farming crowd&#x2014;is that the United States chose the wrong path for ocean agriculture and continues to do so. Over the previous decades, there were countless opportuni�ties to reflect on the unique qualities of the ocean from a farm�ing perspective. If the nation had chosen to focus energies on growing restorative species such as seaweeds rather than jailing and feeding fish, we&#x2019;d have a much more sensible dinner plate today. We&#x2019;d be feeding the planet while breathing life back into our seas, and protecting wild fish stocks while creating middle-class jobs.<br> &nbsp;<br> There will be gaps in my story. For example, I am estranged from most of my family, a history that I will address with silence. They are good people; I could have been a better man. And I&#x2019;ve worked many different jobs in my life. I&#x2019;ve driven lumber trucks and sold my wood carvings on the streets of New York City. I&#x2019;ve worked on community-organizing campaigns with coal miners, immigrants, and fishermen, and even did a stint for a politician. But these have all been mere tributaries. Though I have been pushed off the water many times in my life, I have always fought to return. This is a tale of a fisherman&#x2019;s forty-five-year search for meaningful work at sea. Maybe one day I&#x2019;ll spin another yarn of my dizzy days on land, but for now I&#x2019;ll stick mostly to the saltier side of my life.<br> &nbsp;<br> A note about foul language. In his book <i>Distant Water: The Fate of the North Atlantic Fisherman, </i>Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author William W. Warner tries to prepare his readers for the cultural shock to come:<br> &nbsp;<br> The fishermen in some chapters swear more than others. No national slights are therefore intended. All fishermen have their choice epithets. . . . Their oaths and swear words are mere interstices&#x2014;points of emphasis, like raising one&#x2019;s voice&#x2014;devoid of literal meaning. The reader should so understand them, and take no offence.<br> &nbsp;<br> So, before we dive in, let me apologize in advance. I write about the slimy, violent end of things, especially in describing my early years. And I swear a fair amount, always have, which has remained a sore point even at home.<br> &nbsp;<br> Convention says I should repent and prefer the sober, inof�fensive, and violence-free life&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t. The knife&#x2019;s edge has been good to me. Making the world a better and more beautiful place isn&#x2019;t about &#x201c;softening&#x201d; for the dinner crowd. It&#x2019;s about the granular hard work of fighting waves and rolling up tat�tooed sleeves to work with nature. It&#x2019;s not about &#x201c;domestica�tion,&#x201d; it&#x2019;s about blue-collar innovation. So leave civility on the docks; hop aboard and revel with me in the profane. It tastes so good.<br> &nbsp;<br> A few words about word choice. While some prefer the term &#x201c;fishers,&#x201d; I use &#x201c;fishermen&#x201d; to refer to both men and women who fish commercially for a living. Many have come to this con�sensus. As Clare Leschin-Hoar, who has extensively covered the fishing industry, explains: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve met many female fishermen . . . and 100 percent of the time, they have told me they like the term &#x2018;fishermen&#x2019;; they don&#x2019;t want to be called fishers.&#x201d; She says women in the fishing industry see the term as a badge of honor. &#x201c;They worked very hard to become commercial fishermen, and they want that respect.&#x201d; I follow their lead.<br> &nbsp;<br> To refer to my farming model, I use &#x201c;restorative ocean farm�ing,&#x201d; &#x201c;regenerative ocean farming,&#x201d; or &#x201c;3D ocean farming.&#x201d; This signals my search for a new lexicon for sea-based agriculture. I hate the term &#x201c;aquaculture,&#x201d; but honestly, I haven&#x2019;t yet settled on what to call my type of farming. Same goes for seaweed, which I refer to as &#x201c;sea greens,&#x201d; &#x201c;sea vegetables,&#x201d; and &#x201c;ocean greens.&#x201d; In some of the more scientific sections, you might even see &#x201c;macroalgae&#x201d;&#x2014;that just means seaweed, too. If you have bet�ter names, let me know; I&#x2019;m keeping a list. Also, for all you land�lubbers: at sea, rope is called &#x201c;line.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>What is restorative ocean farming?</b><br> Picture my farm as a vertical underwater garden: hurricane-proof anchors on the edges connected by horizontal ropes floating six feet below the surface. From these lines, kelp and other kinds of seaweed grow vertically downward, next to scallops in hanging nets that look like Japanese lanterns and mussels held in suspension in mesh socks. On the seafloor below sit oysters in cages, and then clams buried in the mud bottom.<br> &nbsp;<br> My crops are restorative. Shellfish and seaweeds are powerful agents of renewal. A seaweed like kelp is called the &#x201c;sequoia of the sea&#x201d; because it absorbs five times more carbon than land-based plants and is heralded as the culinary equivalent of the electric car. Oysters and mussels filter up to fifty gallons of water a day, removing nitrogen, a nutrient that is the root cause of the ever-expanding dead zones in the ocean. And my farm functions as a storm-surge protector and an artificial reef, both helping to protect shoreline communities and attracting more than 150 species of aquatic life, which come to hide, eat, and thrive.<br> &nbsp;<br> Shellfish and seaweed require zero inputs&#x2014;no freshwater, no fertilizers, no feed. They simply grow by soaking up ocean nutrients, making it, hands down, the most sustainable form of food production on the planet.<br> &nbsp;<br> My farm design is open-source and replicable: just an under�water rope scaffolding that&#x2019;s cheap and easy to build. All you need is $20,000, twenty acres, and a boat. And it churns out a lot of food: up to 150,000 shellfish and ten tons of seaweed per acre. Because it is low-cost to build, it can be replicated quickly. Best of all, you can make a living: one farm can net up to $90,000 to $120,000 per year.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, the model is scalable. There are more than ten thou�sand plants in the ocean, and hundreds of varieties of shellfish. We eat only a few kinds, and we&#x2019;ve barely begun to scratch the surface of what we can grow. Imagine being a chef and discover�ing that there are thousands of vegetable species you&#x2019;ve never cooked with or tasted before. It&#x2019;s like discovering corn, arugula, tomatoes, and lettuce for the first time. Moreover, demand for our crops is not dependent solely on food; our seaweeds can be used as fertilizers, animal feeds, even zero-input biofuels.<br> &nbsp;<br> As ocean farmers, we can simultaneously create jobs, feed the planet, and fight climate change. According to the World Bank, a network of ocean farms equivalent to 5 percent of U.S. territorial waters can have a deep impact with a small footprint, creating fifty million direct jobs, producing protein equivalent to 2.3 trillion hamburgers, and sequestering carbon equal to the output of twenty million cars. Another study found that a network of farms totaling the size of Washington State could supply enough protein for every person living today. And farming 9 percent of the world&#x2019;s oceans could generate enough biofuel to replace all current fossil-fuel energy.</p><h2>Assassination Classroom, Vol. 8 (8)</h2><p>Ever caught yourself screaming, "I could just kill that teacher"?

While considering ways of making the precepts of this divine book more readily available to the reader, a distinguishing format was devised to isolate the doctrinal precepts and at the same time render this rather complex volume of scripture more comprehensible for reading and pondering. Not one word, letter or even a punctuation mark of the actual text has been deleted or altered in the process. Only the formatting has been enhanced by adding wider margins for notes, two type sizes, and spaces between textual subdivisions. These contextual enhancements are designed to help the reader more readily visualize the context, speaker and doctrine of the Book of Mormon narrative. <br>This edition of the Book of Mormon divides the text into 214 events or episodes. An event-based approach provides an alternate way to read the scripture text without the obvious intrusion of verse and chapter breaks which can obscure the narrative as it was originally written or even the continuity of doctrinal discourses. Short text headings in the margins indicate names of speakers, chronological dates, locational information and other scriptural references. These marginal annotations allow the reader to quickly and consistently place the Book of Mormon historical narrative within space and time.</p><p>Starting in the 1980s as a father and son team we developed and helped the Church publish the first online edition of the scriptures. Parallel to that project we considered ways to isolate the doctrinal precepts by reformatting the scriptures for easier reading and pondering. We also investigated ways to go beyond merely searching electronically for words in the text. We quickly discovered this reformatted edition emphasizing events rather than chapters was our preferred way to study.<br>More than a decade in the making, A New Approach to Studying the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ has been our labor of love. We are ever mindful of the long line of record keepers from Ether to Nephi to Mormon to Joseph Smith who have made this edition possible. We express appreciation to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for providing a license to publish the text of the 2013 edition of the scriptures. <br>We add our testimony to the millions before us that The Book of Mormon is a true account of the Nephite, Lamanite and Jaredite people, and its translation came by gift and power of God. We also testify The Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ and contains the gospel doctrines of salvation that lead to joy and happiness.<br>Lynn A. Rosenvall<br>David L RosenvallThis formatted edition provides a superior way to understand the settings and context of the Book of Mormon text. --Dr. R. Kent Crookston, Professor and Dean (emeritus), Brigham Young University<br><br>I highly recommend to all readers of the Book of Mormon, this innovative approach to studying the doctrines of Jesus Christ. --Dr. John P.

That might have been the end of everything, almost before it had begun. Neighbours inquisitive, the police called in to investigate. No, that would not do at all. Next time he would tie the gag a little tighter, just a little tighter, just that little bit more secure. <p></p>Afterwards, he went to the drawer and took from it a ball of string. He used a pair of sharp nail-scissors, the kind girls always seem to use, to snip off a length of about six inches, then he put the ball of string and the scissors back into the drawer. A car revved up outside, and he went to the window, upsetting a pile of books on the floor as he did so. The car, however, had vanished, and he smiled to himself. He tied a knot in the string, not any special kind of knot, just a knot. There was an envelope lying ready on the sideboard. <p></p>Excerpted from Knots and Crosses by Ian Rankin. <p></p>Copyright � 2006, 1987 by Ian Rankin. <p></p>Published in 1987 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press <p></p>All rights reserved.

Akin, and Tony Merida, this new commentary series, projected to be 48 volumes, takes a Christ-centered approach to expositing each book of the Bible. Rather than a verse-by-verse approach, the authors have crafted chapters that explain and apply key passages in their assigned Bible books. Readers will learn to see Christ in all aspects of Scripture, and they will be encouraged by the devotional nature of each exposition.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Exalting Jesus in Ephesians</i> is written by Tony Merida.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Tony Merida</b> is lead pastor of Imago Dei Church in Raleigh, North Carolina.

From the Old Testament that anticipates him, to the Gospels that manifest him, to the Book of Acts that proclaims him, to the Epistles that explain him, and to the Book of Revelation that tells of him coming again, your Bible is about Jesus. That's why I love the vision of the <i>Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary</i> series.

Lons�daleite is 58 percent harder than diamond and forms only when meteorites smash themselves into Earth.<br><br>���<br><br>The lab mate says to make a list of pros and cons.<br><br>Write it all down, prove it to yourself.<br><br>She then nods sympathetically and pats me on the arm.<br><br>The lab mate is a solver of hard problems. Her desk is next to mine but is neater and more result-�producing.<br><br>Big deal, she says of her many, many publications and doesn&#x2019;t take herself too seriously, is busy but not that busy, talks about things other than chemistry.<br><br>I find her outlook refreshing, yet strange. If I were that accomplished, I would casually bring up my published papers in conversation. Have you read so-�and-�so? Because it is quite worth your time. The tables alone are beautiful and well formatted.<br><br>I have only one paper out. The tables are in fact very beautiful, all clear and double-�spaced line borders. All succinct and informative titles.<br><br>Somewhere I read that the average number of readers for a scientific paper is 0.6.<br><br>So I make the list. The pros are extensive.<br><br>Eric cooks dinner. Eric cooks great dinners. Eric hands me the toothbrush with toothpaste on it and sometimes even sticks it in my mouth. Eric takes out the trash, the recycling; waters all our plants because I can&#x2019;t seem to remember that they&#x2019;re living things. These leaves feel crunchy, he said after the week that he was gone.<br><br>He goes that week to California for a conference with other young and established chemists.<br><br>Also Eric drives me to lab when it&#x2019;s too rainy to bike. Boston sees a great deal of rain. Sometimes the rain comes down horizontal and hits the face.<br><br>Also Eric walks the dog. We have a dog. Eric got him for me.<br><br>I realize that I don&#x2019;t have any cons. I knew this going in.<br><br>It is a half-�list, I tell the lab mate the next day, and she offers to buy me a cookie.<br><br>In lab, there are two boxes filled with argon.

The solvent room officially, but I have renamed it the Fortress of Solitude.<br><br>Eric is no longer in this lab. He graduated last year and is now in another lab.

We met when I was in my first and he was in his second.<br><br>Now I walk around our apartment and trip over his stuff: big black drum bags and steel pots and carboys with brown liquid fermenting inside. Eric plays the drums and brews beer. One con is how much space these two hobbies take up, but this is outweighed by the drums that I like to hear and the beer that I like to drink.<br><br>My pro list grows at an exponential rate.<br><br>���<br><br>We had talked about marriage before. Can you see yourself settling down, having kids? Can you see your�self starting a family? I didn&#x2019;t say no, but I didn&#x2019;t say yes. We had these talks casually. Each time, he thought if actually proposed to, I would say something different.<br><br>At least now all my cards are on the table, he says. But please don&#x2019;t take too long to decide.<br><br>���<br><br>It has been the summer of unbearable heat. At the Home Depot, we go up and down aisles looking for a fan. Our last fan broke yesterday and next week it is supposed to be hotter. Then next month, a hurricane.<br><br>When Eric sees the hurricane report, he wonders if the people who wrote it are just screwing with us.<br><br>Why would they do that? I ask.<br><br>Because it&#x2019;s funny.<br><br>Oh, right. Then a minute later, I laugh.<br><br>Patience is Eric&#x2019;s greatest virtue. He will wait in longer lines than I will and think nothing of it. He will smile, while holding a heavy fan, at the older woman in front of him who has brought a tall stack of lampshades and at the moment of payment is having second thoughts. She asks the clerk for his opinion. She asks Eric. Do I need the magenta? Me, she doesn&#x2019;t bother with, because I am the one with the furiously tapping foot. The woman considers some more, turning each lampshade in her hands, but in the end purchases nothing.<br><br>I tell Eric in the car that if I were to reimagine Hell, it would be no different from the line we were just in. Except the woman would never decide on a lampshade and the line would never move.<br><br>Can you imagine? I say. A worse punishment than pushing that thing up the hill.<br><br>A boulder, Eric says.<br><br>I realize what a hypocrite I&#x2019;m being, to make him wait for an answer and then dwell on a twenty-�five-�minute line.<br><br>Once home, Eric sets the fan up and the dog goes crazy.<br><br>���<br><br>Two years ago, Eric and I moved in together. We do not have a dog but we are thinking about it. What kind? Eric asks. Big? Small? I don&#x2019;t have a preference. How about just adorable?<br><br>When he first brings him home, I hear the tail, long and bushy, thumping against the couch. A forty-�five-�pound goldendoodle. Incredibly adorable. When he runs, his ears flop. If we never groomed him, his hair would keep growing and he would look like a blond bear.<br><br>The blond bear loves people and this is good. But then we discover that he is afraid of everything else: the hair dryer, an empty box, the fan.<br><br>���<br><br>Bad tempers run in my family. It is the dominant allele, like black hair. Eric has red hair. Our friends have asked if there is any way our babies will turn out to be gingers. Gingers are dying out, and our friends are concerned about Eric&#x2019;s beautiful locks.<br><br>I say, Unless Mendel was completely wrong about genetics, our babies will have my hair.<br><br>But our friends can still dream. An Asian baby with red hair. One friend says, You could write a Science paper on that and then apply for academic jobs and then get tenure.<br><br>Eric is already looking for academic jobs. He wants to teach at a college that primarily serves undergrads.<br><br>Because they are the future, he says. Eager to learn, energetic, and happy, more or less, as compared with grad students. With undergrads, I can make a real difference.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t say this but I think it: You are the only person I know who talks like that. So enthusiastically and benefit-�of-�the-�doubt-�giving.<br><br>But the colleges he&#x2019;s interested in are not in Boston. They are in places like Oberlin, Ohio.<br><br>I am certain that Eric will get the job. His career path is very straight, like that of an arrow to its target. If I were to draw my path out, it would look like a gas particle flying around in space.<br><br>The lab mate often echoes the wisdom of many chemists before her. You must love chemistry even when it is not working. You must love chemistry unconditionally.<br><br>The friends who ask about the red-�haired babies are the ones recently married or the ones recently married with a dog. Whenever we have them over for dinner, like tonight, they think we are trying to tell them that we are engaged.<br><br>News? they say.<br><br>Not yet, I reply, but here, have some freshly grated Parmesan cheese instead.<br><br>Behind my back, I know they are less kind. They ask each other, It&#x2019;s been four years, hasn&#x2019;t it? They joke, She is only with him for his money.<br><br>It is common knowledge now that graduate students make close to nothing and that there are more PhD scientists in this country than there are jobs for them.<br><br>When Eric first decides to do a PhD, it is in high school. He takes a chemistry class and excels. This is in western Maryland, in a town with many steepled churches but no Starbucks. Every other year we drive three hours from the DC airport, through a gap in the Appalachian Mountains, and arrive at a picturesque place where Eric seems to know everyone. He waves to the man across the horseshoe bar, his former band teacher. He waves to the woman at the post office, the mother of a high school friend. The diner with the horseshoe bar is called Niners. There is always farmland for sale and working mills.<br><br>Sometimes I wonder why he left a place where every ice-�cream shop is called a creamery to work seventy-�hour weeks in lab. He credits the chemistry teacher, who asked him often, What are you going to do afterward? And don&#x2019;t just say stick around.<br><br>���<br><br>A belief among Chinese mothers is that children pick their own traits in the womb. The smart ones work diligently to pick the better traits. The dumb ones get easily flustered and fall asleep. For their laziness, they are then dealt the worse traits.<br><br>Or perhaps this is just a belief of my own mother.<br><br>Had you chosen better, you would have not ended up with your father&#x2019;s terrible temper or my poor vision.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t want to believe this but it has become so ingrained. Compared with mine, Eric&#x2019;s temper is nonexistent.<br><br>Thursday, trash day. We pick the wrong streets to go down and drive for miles behind a garbage truck. It is a one-�way road. It is also a one-�lane road. But not once does he sigh or complain. He puts on jazz music instead. Listen to this, he says. But all I hear is the going and stopping of the truck, the picking up and dumping of trash, the clanking of metal bins. So frustrated am I after one song that I lean over and press the horn for him. Then out the window, I shout at the truck, Excuse me, do you mind?<br><br>���<br><br>The PhD advisor visits my desk, sits down, brings his hands together, and asks, Where do you see your project going in five years?<br><br>Five years? I say in disbelief. I would hope to be graduated by then and in the real world with a job.<br><br>I see, he says. Perhaps then it is time to start a new project, one that is more within your capabilities.<br><br>He leaves me to it.<br><br>The desire to throw something at his head never goes away. Depending on what he says, it is either the computer or the desk.<br><br>I sketch out possible projects. Alchemy, for one. If I could achieve that today, I could graduate tomorrow.<br><br>A guy in lab strongly believes that women do not belong in science. He&#x2019;s said that women lack the balls to actually do science.<br><br>Which isn&#x2019;t wrong. We do lack balls.<br><br>But if he had said that to me at the start of grad school, I would have punched him. Coming in, I think myself the best at chemistry. In high school, I win a national award for it. I say, cockily, at orientation, Yes, that was me, only to realize that everyone else had won it as well, at some point, in addition to awards I have never won.<br><br>The lab guy is still around. He works with the lab mate. If all goes well, they will have another paper next year and then they will graduate.<br><br>Women lack the balls to do science, he still says. With the exception of your lab mate. She has three.<br><br>Later I ask Eric, How many balls do you think I have?<br><br>It is poor timing. We have just gotten into bed and started to kiss.<br><br>Uh, none? he says, and the kissing is over. I was hoping he would have said something along the lines of three and a half.<br><br>���<br><br>A Chinese proverb: Outside of sky there is sky, outside of people there are people.<br><br>It is the idea of infinity and also that there will always be someone better than you.<br><br>Eric says the proverb reminds him of a story from Indian philosophy.<br><br>Three hundred years ago, the world was believed to be a flat plate that rested on an elephant that rested on a turtle. Below that turtle was another turtle and below that turtle was another one. It was turtles all the way down.</p><h2>Woodlawn: One Hope. One Dream.

But on the morning of September 2, 1965, six students quietly enrolled for the first day of classes at Woodlawn High School. They were the first African Americans to ever attend classes at the historically lily-white school, which was among the last of the city&#x2019;s public schools to integrate blacks into its student body.<br> <br>Among these students was a teenager named Cynthia Holder and her two cousins and their three neighbors. Cynthia, who was fifteen years old at the time, was about to begin her junior year, after spending the previous two school years at Phillips High School. At the beginning of the summer, her cousin and best friend, Rita Eileen King, told Cynthia that she and her brother Cedric were going to integrate Woodlawn High, along with three other students from their church&#x2014;Myrtice Chamblin, Lily Humphries, and Leon Humphries.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rita and I grew up like sisters and were very close,&#x201d; said Holder, who is now Cynthia Holder Davis Thompson and lives in Birmingham. &#x201c;The other kids and their pastor decided they wanted to integrate Woodlawn High School. Whatever Rita wanted to do, I was going to be a part of.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jesse Dansby, the pastor of Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Birmingham, spent the next few months preparing the six teenagers for what they might face at Woodlawn High. He gave them Scripture to read, including Psalm 37:1&#x2013;9, which Cynthia read from her Bible every morning for strength:<br> <br>Do not fret because of those who are evil or be envious of those who do wrong; for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away.<br> <br>Trust in the Lord and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.<br> <br>Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.<br> <br>Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him and he will do this:<br> <br>He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn, your vindication like the noonday sun.<br> <br>Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him; do not fret when people succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes.<br> <br>Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret&#x2014;it leads only to evil.<br> <br>For those who are evil will be destroyed, but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.<br> <br>&#x201c;He gave the Scripture to us to get our minds right and to prepare for what we were going to face,&#x201d; Holder said. &#x201c;We had to be groomed to go. I think Reverend Dansby and our parents did a good job of letting us know what to expect and how to act.&#x201d;<br> <br>She and the other African American students were aware they wouldn&#x2019;t be warmly greeted at their new school. Woodlawn High School was established in 1916 to educate the children of the white sales managers, engineers, and other executives who lived in the attractive Craftsman bungalows and Tudor Revival cottages in the booming Woodlawn Highlands neighborhood of East Birmingham.<br> <br>The Woodlawn High School building, which was designed by architect Harry B. Wheelock and completed in January 1922, was more of a cathedral than a schoolhouse. The three-story brick building looked like a castle, complete with towers, Gothic arches, and tall spires shooting straight into the sky. The school&#x2019;s finely detailed auditorium even included a balcony. From 1934 to 1939, Sidney van Sheck and Richard Blauvelt Coe painted a large mural&#x2014;seventy feet wide by eight feet tall&#x2014;on the proscenium arch of the auditorium for the Works Progress Administration. The mural&#x2019;s inscription read: &#x201c;Gloried Be They Who Foresaking Unjust Riches Strive in Fulfillment of Humble Tasks for Peace Culture and the Equality of All Mankind.&#x201d;<br> <br>However, there was nothing equal about Woodlawn High School. For nearly a half century, its doors were closed to African American students in America&#x2019;s most divided city. There were five all-white high schools in Birmingham&#x2014;Ensley, Phillips, Ramsay, West End, and Woodlawn. Until 1963, no black student had ever attended classes at any of the high schools.<br> <br>There were three high schools for black students in Birmingham: Hayes, Parker, and Ullman. Parker High opened as the Negro High School in 1900, and after it was renamed in honor of its first principal, A. H. Parker, in 1946, it had an enrollment of 3,761 students, making it the country&#x2019;s largest all-black school. As the threat of federal desegregation loomed, Birmingham officials expanded Ullman High with a new three-story classroom wing in 1957, and then the new all-black Hayes High School opened on a seventeen-acre campus in 1960.<br> <br>Not even federal court orders could break racial barriers in Alabama. On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the separate but equal doctrine in American public schools in its historic Brown v. Board of Education decision. In an eleven-page opinion written by Chief Justice Earl Warren, the court firmly ruled: &#x201c;We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of &#x2018;separate but equal&#x2019; has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.&#x201d;<br> <br>But the Brown v. Board of Education decision fell on mostly deaf ears in Alabama, where segregation and Jim Crow laws were deeply embedded in the state&#x2019;s thick, red clay. In the 1950s, African Americans in Birmingham were still required to ride in the back of city buses, drink from &#x201c;colored&#x201d; water fountains, and use separate restrooms. Blacks weren&#x2019;t allowed to eat at downtown lunch counters and restaurants, and there were segregated movie theaters, department stores, parks, and swimming pools. Black high school football teams couldn&#x2019;t play at Legion Field, the &#x201c;Old Gray Lady,&#x201d; which hosted University of Alabama games and was considered the football capital of the South.<br> <br>Although 40 percent of Birmingham&#x2019;s population of nearly 350,000 residents in 1950 was black, the city had no African American police officers, firefighters, or elected officials. Only whites were hired as bus drivers, bank tellers, sales clerks, and cashiers in department stores. Black secretaries couldn&#x2019;t work for white businessmen, and white nurses weren&#x2019;t permitted to care for black patients, and vice versa. Even prison chain gangs were segregated&#x2014;�white inmates couldn&#x2019;t be shackled to black prisoners.<br> <br>Seven years after Jackie Robinson famously broke Major League Baseball&#x2019;s color barrier in 1947, and long after public schools in other regions of the country started opening their doors to black students, Birmingham was determined to keep its draconian Jim Crow laws intact no matter the cost. There were even city ordinances in place that made it unlawful for a &#x201c;Negro and a white person to play together or in company with each other in any game of cards, dice, dominoes, checkers, baseball, softball, football, basketball or similar games.&#x201d; If blacks and whites couldn&#x2019;t play together, they certainly weren&#x2019;t allowed to learn together.<br> <br>In 1969, African American Julius Clark was hired as an industrial arts teacher and boys&#x2019; advisor at Woodlawn High. He had grown up in the Collegeville neighborhood in North Birmingham, one of the few areas reserved for black residents under the city&#x2019;s strict segregation laws. Clark attended all-black schools and his only interaction with white people occurred on the weekends or during the summers, when he went to nearby all-white neighborhoods to find domestic work. Clark spent many mornings cutting grass, raking leaves, and polishing floors for white families. He usually earned one dollar for four hours of work, which was enough money to pay for admission and concessions at an all-black movie theater. White women often gave him a sandwich and bottle of Coca-Cola for lunch.<br> <br>&#x201c;I rode behind the colored sign on the bus. I drank from the colored water fountain,&#x201d; Clark said. &#x201c;I stepped off the sidewalk and onto the curb when the white ladies walked by. When I was old enough to register to vote, I paid the three-dollar poll tax and answered the crazy quizzes those people came up with. I followed the rules and regulations of the system.&#x201d;<br> <br>The civil rights struggle occurred in two waves in Birmingham and each was met with much resistance and violence. After the Brown v. Board of Education decision, it took civil rights activists three long, conflict-ridden years to challenge Birmingham&#x2019;s segregation laws in schools. On August 20, 1957, Arthur Shores, one of the first and most successful African American attorneys in Alabama, petitioned the Birmingham Board of Education to admit thirteen black children from nine families to schools closest to their homes&#x2014;all-white Graymont Elementary, Phillips High, and Woodlawn High. Shores, who attended segregated schools in Alabama as a child and then law school at the University of Kansas, became a civil rights pioneer after winning high-profile cases that had never before been litigated by black attorneys in the Deep South.<br> <br>Despite Shores&#x2019;s growing reputation and successes, three African American families dropped their requests for transfers because of threats of violence. White supremacists weren&#x2019;t going to lie down. On Labor Day 1957, a group of Ku Klux Klansmen kidnapped a randomly chosen African American man while he was walking down a Birmingham road with his girlfriend. The six men took the mildly mentally disabled black man, J. Edward &#x201c;Judge&#x201d; Aaron, back to their Klan lair, where they beat and interrogated him. When the men were finished, they asked Aaron if he wanted to die or be castrated. Aaron chose to live, so the men mutilated him and left him in a creek bed, where he nearly bled to death before police found him. According to police, the men told Aaron it would happen to &#x201c;any Negro sending his child to a white school.&#x201d; Birmingham police later arrested the suspects and charged them with mayhem. Two of the men turned state&#x2019;s witnesses, and the other four were convicted and sentenced to twenty years in prison. They were later pardoned by Alabama Governor George C. Wallace.<br> <br>During a Birmingham Board of Education meeting that was attended by three Klansmen, the board tabled Shores&#x2019;s request to allow African American children to attend the schools closest to their homes. But Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth&#x2014;who had filed a transfer petition on his two daughters&#x2019; behalf&#x2014;decided he wouldn&#x2019;t wait for a decision. Shuttlesworth&#x2019;s home had been bombed the previous Christmas Day, so he was well aware of the dangers of challenging segregationists. The bombing of Reverend Shuttlesworth&#x2019;s home wasn&#x2019;t an isolated incident. The Klan lighted so much dynamite in Birmingham during the 1950s and early 1960s that the city became known as &#x201c;Bombingham.&#x201d; After Shuttlesworth&#x2019;s house was bombed, he emerged from the basement unscathed and led hundreds of African Americans onto buses in defiance of Jim Crow laws the next day.<br> <br>On the morning of September 9, 1957, Shuttlesworth attempted to enroll his daughters, Patricia Ann and Ruby Fredericka, and two boys from their neighborhood&#x2014;twelve-year-old Walter Wilson and seventeen-year-old Nathaniel Lee&#x2014;at John Herbert Phillips High School. Two hours after the school day started, Reverend Shuttlesworth, his wife, Ruby, their bodyguard, and another civil rights activist drove the children to the school. A group of about twenty Klansmen was waiting for them at Phillips High, and the men attacked Shuttlesworth as he climbed out of the car. Other men tried to pull his wife, daughters, and the two boys from the car before police intervened. Reverend Shuttlesworth ran from the mob to divert the attackers&#x2019; attention. He was knocked to the ground and beaten with brass knuckles, metal chains, and wooden clubs.<br> <br>The reverend and his wife were treated for cuts and bruises at University Hospital. He vowed to try to enroll the students again the next morning. &#x201c;Whether they kill us or not,&#x201d; he told The Birmingham News. Even though Shuttlesworth decided to postpone his plans for the next day, that didn&#x2019;t stop crowds of white segregationists from gathering outside Phillips High and other schools in anticipation of their return to their all-white schools.<br> <br>When students arrived at Woodlawn High School on September 10, 1957, two hanging black effigies greeted them. Another one was hung that morning. Woodlawn High students boycotted classes in protest of possible integration, even though principal Ralph Martin threatened them with suspension. A handful of Woodlawn High students staged an impromptu demonstration at the school&#x2019;s flagpole, where they raised two Confederate flags. Other students defiantly waved the Confederate Stars and Bars while chanting, &#x201c;Two! Four! Six! Eight! We don&#x2019;t want to integrate!&#x201d; The Birmingham News reported that assistant police chief J. C. Lance stopped two cars containing ten Woodlawn High students and confiscated a heavy club and a plastic-covered sack of firecrackers.<br> <br>&#x201c;A number of students boycotted classes at Woodlawn High School this morning in protests against integration,&#x201d; The Birmingham News reported. &#x201c;Youths demonstrated noisily on the school grounds and threw rocks at passing buses containing Negroes. They also jeered at passing automobiles containing Negroes.&#x201d;<br> <br>A few days later, Shuttlesworth abandoned his plans and Birmingham&#x2019;s public schools remained segregated. It seemed the all-white schools would remain closed to African Americans forever. On January 14, 1963, newly elected Alabama governor Wallace delivered his infamous inauguration speech, in which he proclaimed, &#x201c;In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth, I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny, and I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.&#x201d; Six months later, Wallace stood in a doorway of a building at the University of Alabama and blocked the entrance of two African American students trying to enroll at the school.<br> <br>The summer of 1963 changed the course of history in Birmingham and the United States. Dr. Martin Luther King and other leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights and Southern Christian Leadership Conference led sit-ins at lunch counters and marches in the streets of Birmingham. King and other leaders were repeatedly jailed for their efforts. In a moment that would ultimately be a turning point in the civil rights movement, Birmingham public safety commissioner Eugene &#x201c;Bull&#x201d; Connor ordered his officers to turn their dogs and water hoses on thousands of student protesters during the Children&#x2019;s Crusade. Hundreds of young demonstrators were arrested and expelled from Birmingham schools, until federal courts intervened.<br> <br>Finally, Birmingham School Board attorneys announced on August 30, 1963, that three schools&#x2014;Graymont Elementary, Ramsay High, and West End High&#x2014;would be desegregated. Demonstrators chanted and waved Confederate flags when eleven-�year-old Dwight Armstrong and his ten-year-old brother, Floyd, attempted to enroll at Graymont Elementary on September 4, 1963. That night, attorney Arthur Shores&#x2019;s home was bombed for the second time in fifteen days and riots erupted in the streets. One man was shot dead and twenty-one others were injured. The next day, as President John F. Kennedy anguished over federal intervention in Birmingham, Wallace ordered the city to close the schools.<br> <br>After a federal court order reopened the schools, the Armstrong brothers enrolled at Graymont Elementary on September 9, 1963. Richard Walker, another black student, enrolled at Ramsay High, and Patricia Marcus and Josephine Powell became the first black students at West End High.

No other teacher has ever understood her impulsiveness, her itch to draw constantly, or her need to play "Beat the Clock" when the day feels too long. And in his place, he's left a substitute with a whole new set of rules that Clementine just can't figure out. The only solution, she decides, is to hatch a plan to get Mr. D'Matz back. If it means ruining her teacher's once-in-a-lifetime chance -- well, it's worth it. Isn't it?<br></p><p>Sara Pennypacker was a painter before becoming a writer, and has two absolutely fabulous children who are now grown. She has written several books, including <em>Clementine </em>and<em> The Talented Clementine</em>, illustrated by Marla Frazee;<i> Stuart's </i><i>Cape</i><i> </i>and<em> Stuart Goes to School, </em>both illustrated by Martin Matje, and <em>Dumbstruck</em>. Sara lives in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.<br>Marla Frazee did the illustrations for the first two books in the <em>Clementine </em>series. She is author/illustrator of <em>Walk On!</em>, <em>Santa Claus the World's Number One Toy Expert</em>, and <em>Roller Coaster</em>. She is also the illustrator of <em>The </em><em>Seven Silly Eaters, Everywhere Babies,</em>and a bunch of other books. Marla works in a small backyard cabin under an avocado tree in Pasadena, California.Clementine's only just "getting the hang of third grade"-she hasn't been sent to Principal Rice's office for a whole week-when her world turns upside-down: Her beloved Teacher is a finalist for an Adventures for Teachers award, and if he wins, he'll be gone for the rest of the year. As it is, he's absent for a week to prepare, and life with his substitute does not go well. Mrs. Nagel doesn't know any of the tricks Teacher did that helped to keep Clementine "in sync" with the classroom, so when Principal Rice asks the children to write letters of nomination to the award committee, Clementine sees her opportunity to sabotage his success. Pennypacker and Frazee have this latter-day Ramona down to a T, her distinctive voice and unruly curls happily unblunted by familiarity. The great success of this outing, however, lies in the warmth of the relationship between Clementine and Teacher, whose humane and sympathetic understanding of his admittedly difficult scholar will strike a welcome chord with readers, especially those out-of-sync students and their teachers Kirkus"<br><br>Just as the bouncy Clementine is finally getting the hang of third grade, with the help of her very understanding teacher, she learns that he is a finalist in a contest to study in his beloved Egypt. While he is away for a preliminary week, Clementine immediately gets into difficulties with the substitute. "I can't guess Mrs. Nagel's rules...She doesn't tell them until it's too late and I'm already in trouble." Clementine tries to sabotage her teacher's trip by writing a negative letter to the award committee, but she redeems herself at the end. Subplots involve Clementine's selling-off of her neighbors' charity donations and a notebook she and her building-superintendent dad use to write a story together. This may be the best entry so far in the series, as Pennypacker develops her ingenious but impulsive character with less reliance on cutesy phrases in Clementine's narration. And Frazee's line drawings go a little further this time in showing Clementine's highly charged emotions and her capacity for creating chaos in her surroundings. Horn Book"<br><br>Irrepressible and delightful Clementine is back. She is enjoying third grade she is in sync with her teacher, Mr. D'Matz, and is rarely sent to speak with Principal Rice, a major accomplishment in her school life. Then Mr. D'Matz is selected as one of three finalists for an Adventures for Teachers archaeological dig in Egypt and leaves for a week to meet with the committee. Clementine is distraught to learn that if chosen as the winner, he will be gone for the rest of the school year. When the substitute arrives, Clementine learns that she has to follow completely different rules. The next week is not an easy one for the child as she adjusts to Mrs. Nagel, worries about losing Mr. D'Matz, copes with her everyday life as an impulsive eight-year-old, and frets about the letter she is supposed to write to the prize committee about her teacher. Through it all, she shines with a vibrant spirit that can never be completely extinguished, even when she is feeling down. Frazee's pen-and-ink drawings perfectly capture Clementine's personality and her world. SLJ"</p><h2>The Library: A World History</h2><p>A library is not just a collection of books, but also the buildings that house them. As varied and inventive as the volumes they hold, such buildings can be much more than the dusty, dark wooden shelves found in mystery stories or the catacombs of stacks in the basements of academia. From the great dome of the Library of Congress, to the white fa�ade of the Sein�joki Library in Finland, to the ancient ruins of the library of Pergamum in modern Turkey, the architecture of a library is a symbol of its time as well as of its builders&#x2019; wealth, culture, and learning.&nbsp;Architectural historian James Campbell and photographer Will Pryce traveled the globe together, visiting and documenting over eighty libraries that exemplify the many different approaches to thinking about and designing libraries. The result of their travels, <i>The Library: A World History</i> is one of the first books to tell the story of library architecture around the world and through time in a single volume, from ancient Mesopotamia to modern China and from the beginnings of writing to the present day. As these beautiful and striking photos reveal, each age and culture has reinvented the library, molding it to reflect their priorities and preoccupations&#x2014;and in turn mirroring the history of civilization itself. Campbell&#x2019;s authoritative yet readable text recounts the history of these libraries, while Pryce&#x2019;s stunning photographs vividly capture each building&#x2019;s structure and atmosphere. &nbsp;Together, Campbell and Pryce have produced a landmark book&#x2014;the definitive photographic history of the library and one that will be essential for the home libraries of book lovers and architecture devotees alike. <br></p><p><b>James W. P. Campbell</b> is a fellow and director of studies in architecture and history of art at Queens&#x2019; College, Cambridge. His most recent books include <i>Brick: A World History</i> (also with Will Pryce) and <i>Building St Paul&#x2019;s</i>. Will Pryce is an award-winning photographer based in London who originally trained as an architect. His previous books include <i>World Architecture: The Masterworks</i>, <i>Big Shed</i>, and <i>The Architecture of Wood: A World History</i>.<br>"In a new book,<i> The Library: A World History</i>, author James Campbell and photographer Will Pryce survey the world's libraries, from the expansive new National Library of China to the Tripitaka Koreana, which was built in 1251 in South Korea and is one of the oldest intact libraries in the world. The book is full of interesting asides." (<i>Boston Globe</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Campbell&#x2019;s new history of library architecture, with spectacular photographs by Pryce, takes us on a global tour . . . from the clay tablet storehouses of ancient Mesopotamia and the beautiful repositories of Buddhist sutra blocks and paper prints in Korea and Japan, to the grandiose designs and multimedia extravaganzas of the 21st century. . . .<i>The Library: A World History</i> puts such creations into long perspective, showing how book technology, readers&#x2019; needs and architectural solutions have co-evolved (or, occasionally, been at loggerheads).&#x201d; (<i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The photographs by Will Pryce are technically flawless, and they give point and purpose to a text which is not only informative but persuasive.

His experience in the industry and as a screenwriting professor and coach have led him to recognize that it's the selection of the initial idea that is the most important part of the process -- with the most impact on the project's chance of success. </p><p><br>And as Mr. Bork knows from experience, this choice takes a lot more understanding and work to get "right" than it might seem.</p><p><br>Most screenwriters and fiction writers have difficulty getting their work read and accepted by agents, editors and producers mainly because their idea for a story presented in a query or pitch doesn't excite these "gatekeepers" like it would need to, for them to want to engage. And when they do read the whole story, their core reasons for "passing" are usually also about the basic idea (although lack of professional-level execution matters, too). But writers are usually in the dark about this, not realizing that the project they spent months or years on had fundamental flaws on a concept level, in the eyes of the people they most hoped to impress with it.</p><p><br>But even the best fiction writing books and screenwriting experts tend to move quickly past the crucial step of choosing a viable idea, to get to the specific plotting and composition of it, because there is so much to master in those later parts of the process -- which feel a lot more like "writing" than developing and mulling over potential story concepts.</p><p><br>Professionals, though, tend to understand the primacy of "the idea," and learn that there are certain key elements in story or series premises that really work, and which are worth investing time and energy in. And that's what <strong><i>The Idea</i></strong> focuses on -- laying out what those specific elements are, and how to master them.</p><p><br>While its concepts originate from the author's screenwriting experiences, they apply equally to commercial fiction writing, playwriting and other forms of &#x201c;story&#x201d; -- because the focus is on what makes an underlying concept compelling enough to appeal to a substantial audience or readership.</p><p><br>The "Seven Elements of a Viable Story" in <strong><i>The Idea</i></strong> form an acronym for the word PROBLEM, since every story is really about one, at its core.</p><p><br>Each chapter focuses on one of these seven deceptively simple-looking aspects of a strong story, which are anything but easy to master. Mr. Bork highlights his own struggles as a writer, and his arrival at an understanding of how each of these elements works -- and how to know if one's idea really succeeds at each of them. A special section devoted to television writing (and its unique attributes) ends each chapter.</p><p><br>Whatever your education and background in writing or story, this book and its unique focus contributes foundationally useful information not covered elsewhere -- which may be the missing piece that leads to greater results, both on the page and in the marketplace.</p></p><p>Erik Bork won two Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards for his work as a writer-producer on the HBO miniseries <i><b>Band of Brothers</b></i> and <b><i>From the Earth to the Moon</i>,</b> for executive producer Tom Hanks (and Steven Spielberg, on <i><b>Band of Brothers</b></i>).

It sets forth biblical proof and irrefutable evidence that will cause the scales to fall from your eyes and reveal that the world you thought existed is a myth. The most universally accepted scientific belief today is that the earth is a globe, spinning on its axis at a speed of approximately 1,000 miles per hour at the equator, while at the same time it is orbiting the sun at approximately 66,600 miles per hour. All of this is happening as the sun, in turn, is supposed to be hurtling through the Milky Way galaxy at approximately 500,000 miles per hour. The Milky Way galaxy, itself, is alleged to be racing through space at a speed ranging from 300,000 to 1,340,000 miles per hour. What most people are not told is that the purported spinning, orbiting, and speeding through space has never been proven. In fact, every scientific experiment that has ever been performed to determine the motion of the earth has proven that the earth is stationary. Yet, textbooks ignore the scientific proof that contradicts the myth of a spinning and orbiting globe. Christian schools have been hoodwinked into teaching heliocentrism, despite the clear teaching in the bible that the earth is not a sphere and does not move. This book reveals the evil forces behind the heliocentric deception, and why scientists and the Christian churches have gone along with it.</p></p><p><p>Unsolicited Reviews Posted on Amazon of the Previous Edition of The Greatest Lie on Earth</p><p>"One of the top 3 absolute best books I&#x2019;ve ever read!

Hendrie goes through great details in this book, from the moon landing to CGI and composite photos of the earth to numerous scientific experiments showing that the earth is stationary. I'm very very glad that I bought this book. I also tried to fact check some things mentioned in this book and everything was there after a quick Google search.&#x201d; Derek Fernandez</p><p>"This is the second most important book I have read after the Holy Bible. First of all this book conclusively proves the earth is flat with endless irrefutable examples. Second, the author exposes who is behind this tremendous deception and why. This book is loaded with information on every page and is extremely easy to read." Russell Buecher</p><p>"Well written, well-researched book. I found this book fascinating, and also very disturbing. Fascinating since it's hard for me to imagine that I don't live in a heliocentric type of universe, disturbing in the depth, power, and evil nature of the forces that created this deception. I would love to dismiss the conspiracy aspect of this book, but, it's very well referenced and is not truly conspiratorial due to its sourcing. It's more of an account of events with sources given that we just haven't heard about before since it wasn't well reported on. Hendrie does a great job tying all the strings together, this really is a stand-alone book which could include many other books on different topics yet it is briefly all covered here in sufficient detail to give a good overall picture."

Written in a straightforward and highly readable style, <b>Construction Project Management</b> provides the reader with crucial background information often overlooked in other texts: The roles of the major players owners and designers, general and specialty contractors; Why contractors should avoid some jobs, and how to get the right ones; What bidding is, and why the low bid is not always the best bid; Why different types of construction contracts carry different levels of risk; Why cost estimates and schedules are keys to project success; How a contractor brings in a job on time and on budget; And much more: Alternative project delivery and BIM; Change orders and getting paid; MasterFormat; ConsensusDocs and AIA Documents; An expanded and updated introduction to Green Construction.</p><p>Alison Dykstra, AIA, CSI has been a registered architect for over 30 years and began teaching construction management in the early 1990s. This textbook draws on her extensive professional and classroom experience to explain the complex systems of construction management in a highly accessible way that meets the needs of both beginners and seasoned contractors. She is also author of a text on <b>Green Construction.</b>Dykstra, an architect and teacher of construction management courses, offers an introduction to managing contracted construction projects... By and large, the chapters tend to address issues of the construction contract process chronologically, and this feature is helpful to the reader. Additionally, each chapter contains definitions of the relevant nomenclature and a set of self-test questions. The premise of the coverage of topics is that the design of the work has already been completed, and that the actual implementation of the construction will need to be accomplished by a construction contractor. Although the book discusses project management topics such as estimating and scheduling, the thrust of the work is on contract management issues such as the bidding environment, bidding process, incremental payments, and contract-related negotiations. This book is useful for students taking introductory courses in construction management at both four-year and two-year colleges. Summing Up: Recommended.

How can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world help us to create digital worlds? This book focuses on a range of programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems, from elementary concepts in mathematics and physics to more advanced algorithms that enable sophisticated visual results. Readers will progress from building a basic physics engine to creating intelligent moving objects and complex systems, setting the foundation for further experiments in generative design. Subjects covered include forces, trigonometry, fractals, cellular automata, self-organization, and genetic algorithms. The book&#39;s examples are written in Processing, an open-source language and development environment built on top of the Java programming language. On the book&#39;s website (http://www.natureofcode.com), the examples run in the browser via Processing&#39;s JavaScript mode.</p><p>Daniel Shiffman is an Assistant Arts Professor in the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU&#39;s Tisch School of the Arts.

It feels like you may never recover sometimes. But Lodro Rinzler has wonderfully good news for those suffering heartbreak: the 2,500-year-old teachings of the Buddha are the ultimate antidote for emotional pain. And you don't need to be a Buddhist for them to apply to you. In this short and compact first-aid kit for a broken heart, he walks you through the cause and cure of suffering, with much practical advice for self-care as you work to survive a breakup. The wisdom he presents applies to any kind of emotional suffering. It's a great, practical offering of consolation for someone you know who's going through a tough time, and for yourself when you're looking for the light at the end of the tunnel in your own situation.</p><p>LODRO RINZLER is a teacher in the Shambhala tradition of Vajrayana Buddhism.

If you have ever wished for a smart, kind, discerning, and ridiculously funny friend to accompany you, encourage you, challenge you, make you laugh, and point you in the direction of true healing, here he is."&#x2014;Susan Piver, author of <i>Start Here Now </i>and <i>The Wisdom of a Broken Heart<br><br></i>&#x201c;The good news about heartbreak is that it, like any painful emotional state, will eventually change--guaranteed. But until that guarantee kicks in, Lodro Rinzler&#x2019;s book serves as one of the best first-aid kits I&#x2019;ve seen. He offers the heartbroken much realistic&nbsp; comfort, but also insight that will be useful not only for navigating their own way in&nbsp; the sea of painful emotions, but for being a source of consolation to others. &#x201d; David Richo, author of&nbsp;<i>How to Be an Adult in Relationships<br></i></p><h2>No Second Chance: A Suspense Thriller</h2><p><b>When his child is taken, a father will stop at nothing to get her back in this explosive, white-knuckle thriller from #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author Harlan Coben.<br><br></b><i>When the first bullet hit my chest, I thought of my daughter...<br><br></i>Shot twice by an unseen assailant, Dr. Marc Seidman lies in a hospital bed.

Judging from the sound of the hoofbeats and the rattling of the vehicle, they were moving briskly along a dirt road. His hands were bound together behind his back with strong, slender cords. Iron manacles encircled his ankles, biting into his skin when he tried to pull free. The coarse material against his face threatened to induce a claustrophobic panic, though he could breathe reasonably well.<br> <br>Unpleasant sensations assailed him&#x2014;hunger, thirst, soreness, exhaustion.<br> <br>Having just returned from the echolands, he found ownership of a physical body startlingly unfamiliar. He had not felt hungry in a long while. Or sore.<br> <br>Cole had been warned before returning to his body. He knew he had been captured, along with Destiny, Honor, and Desmond. Their bodies had been left behind at the Temple of the Robust Sky when they had departed for the echolands, and their defenseless physical forms had fallen into the power of Enforcers.<br> <br>The prelate Elana had placed their bodies in a secret room for safekeeping. Clearly something had gone wrong. Wherever Elana was now, Cole hoped she was all right.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; Cole called, not at full volume but hopefully loud enough for any other prisoners sharing the wagon to hear.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cole?&#x201d; a voice answered, slightly muffled.<br> <br>It was Destiny. Tessa. Mira&#x2019;s youngest sister, who he had just rescued in the echolands.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here too,&#x201d; Honor said, her voice clearer and louder, though somewhat dampened as well. Strong and independent, Honor was Mira&#x2019;s second-oldest sister and had helped in the search for Tessa. &#x201c;Desmond?&#x201d;<br> <br>There came no reply.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anybody else?&#x201d; Honor tried.<br> <br>&#x201c;It may just be the three of us,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;Are you tied up too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Manacles on my hands and feet,&#x201d; Honor replied over the creak and rattle of the wagon. &#x201c;Hood over my head.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole wondered if he should be insulted that only his feet had actual manacles.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see either,&#x201d; Destiny said. &#x201c;My hands are tied. My legs are chained.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; Cole said, deciding that he was considered a lesser threat than Honor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you spring us, Cole?&#x201d; Honor asked.<br> <br>It was a fair question. In the echolands, Cole had finally unlocked his power. His shaping ability had become inaccessible after being mangled when he fought Morgassa in Elloweer. Once his power had become active, Cole found he could awaken the shaping power in others, and he had learned to transform objects in the echolands with his will, as if he were a gifted shaper in Sambria.<br> <br>Cole could still feel his power smoldering inside. It had been absent for so long, the presence was unmistakable.<br> <br>In the echolands, he had recently used his power to throw down castle walls. The manacles should not stand a chance. Let alone the fabric of the hood covering his face.<br> <br>Mustering his focus, Cole willed the unseen manacles cuffing his ankles to dissolve.<br> <br>Nothing happened.<br> <br>Cole tugged with his legs against the restraints. The unforgiving iron dug into his skin just as before.<br> <br>Cole willed the fabric of the hood to split apart. He drew on his power with all of his effort.<br> <br>Not a single thread popped.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Cole replied. &#x201c;I can feel my power. But it doesn&#x2019;t seem to be working. I can&#x2019;t make it connect.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I worried it might be different back in a physical body,&#x201d; Honor said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why should it be different?&#x201d; Cole asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;The echolands are made of a whole different kind of matter,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have a physical body there, and you weren&#x2019;t affecting physical material. I&#x2019;ve never heard of anyone developing their power as quickly as you did in the echolands. You have the same abilities here, but using those skills in the physical world may take more time to develop.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole relaxed his mind. Without straining, he tried to push his power at the iron cuffs gripping his ankles. Again he got no result. He refocused on the hood, to no avail.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even tear the hood. But my power is with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re probably taking us to Owandell,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;Once we reach Junction, I should be able to access my power. I&#x2019;ll set us free.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Destiny said, her voice calm and certain. &#x201c;Going before Owandell will lead us to the paths we must walk.&#x201d;<br> <br>For a long moment Cole listened to hoofs clopping and scuffing against the dirt. The wagon jerked, swayed, and creaked.<br> <br>&#x201c;That settles it,&#x201d; Honor said, resignation in her tone. &#x201c;No escape attempt. We wait.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What paths?&#x201d; Cole asked. &#x201c;Where are we going?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Destiny said, sounding like herself once more.<br> <br>&#x201c;No hints?&#x201d; Cole asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Destiny said. &#x201c;It just comes. I never know more than what comes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No apology needed,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;Any guidance helps.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the echolands, Cole had seen Destiny&#x2019;s power in action. Separate from her, in the form of a horse, her power had played a key role in helping him find Destiny, save his friends, and prevent the return of Nazeem, who was really a torivor named Ramarro. Before leaving the afterlife, Destiny&#x2019;s power had been restored to her. And now it was speaking through her.<br> <br>&#x201c;We let the Enforcers take us to Owandell?&#x201d; Cole checked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, if we have any sense,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;No good comes from trying to avoid Tessa&#x2019;s prophecies.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t resist at all?&#x201d; Cole asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;We can try whatever we want after we meet with Owandell,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;Until then we use patience.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to be patient with a bag over your head,&#x201d; Cole observed.<br> <br>The wagon slowed to a stop.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are we there?&#x201d; Cole asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; Honor said in a tone so hushed, Cole could barely hear her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d have some access to my power if we were in Junction. They&#x2019;re probably changing horses.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole heard the clink and jangle of chains at the rear of the wagon.<br> <br>&#x201c;Play possum,&#x201d; Honor suggested quietly.<br> <br>Cole went limp as he heard doors open. The unsteady glow of torchlight flickered up through the bottom of his hood. Somebody was checking on the prisoners. Breathing softly, Cole stayed limp.<br> <br>&#x201c;Still there,&#x201d; a gruff voice affirmed.<br> <br>The door closed.<br> <br>Harnesses jingled and hoofs clopped. A horse whickered. Shortly the wagon lurched forward.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re in a hurry,&#x201d; Honor said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to see Owandell,&#x201d; Tessa said in a voice nearly too small to hear.<br> <br>Cole almost replied that her own power was to blame for their decision to go submissively before the head of the High King&#x2019;s secret police. But since Owandell had used shapecraft&#x2014;the ability to tamper with the shaping power itself&#x2014;to take Destiny&#x2019;s power when she was only nine and give it to her father, Cole decided sensitivity was required.<br> <br>&#x201c;You must hate him,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Owandell scares me,&#x201d; Tessa replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll hurt you again over my dead body,&#x201d; Honor promised.<br> <br>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t comfort me,&#x201d; Tessa said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to lose you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Trust your power,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;It helped save us in the echolands.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Knowing we should talk to Owandell doesn&#x2019;t necessarily spare us from harm,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;Terrible consequences could follow. Destiny&#x2019;s prophecy could simply mean that any efforts to escape would fail. Or it could mean the encounter with Owandell will produce outcomes that need to happen for some higher purpose. But serving a higher purpose is no guarantee of safety.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not very comforting,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does our situation seem comfortable?&#x201d; Honor challenged. &#x201c;We all need to face reality.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think they did with Desmond?&#x201d; Tessa asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t a high enough priority to transfer him to Junction,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;Hopefully, he&#x2019;s just imprisoned back near the Temple of the Robust Sky.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is our reality?&#x201d; Cole asked. &#x201c;Does Owandell want your powers again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;Or else he wants us as hostages.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can he take your powers?&#x201d; Cole asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;He proved he has the ability,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t surrender them willingly the first time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is your father behind this?&#x201d; Cole wondered. Assisted by Owandell, the High King had used shapecraft to steal the powers of his five daughters several decades ago. The absence of their shaping abilities had stopped the princesses from aging. Miracle, Honor, Constance, and Destiny all had their powers back now. Only their eldest sister, Elegance, still lacked her stolen abilities.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hard to say,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;Though Owandell still works for Father, he doesn&#x2019;t collaborate closely with him anymore, and is clearly carrying out his own schemes with Ramarro. We won&#x2019;t know how much Father is involved until this unfolds.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole frowned at the mention of Ramarro. Under the name Nazeem, the torivor had introduced shapecraft into the five kingdoms. Ramarro had just escaped his prison in the echolands, but with help from Cole, the torivor had been diverted to a prison in Creon when he reentered mortality.<br> <br>&#x201c;Owandell stole our powers for Father in the first place,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;I expect Owandell will want to take them again. But I&#x2019;m not going to resist Destiny&#x2019;s foresight. When she speaks under the influence of her gift, I have never known her to be wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How many of the Enforcers are loyal to your father?&#x201d; Cole asked. &#x201c;Could they be taking us to him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Owandell has recently proven that he controls the majority of the Enforcers,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure there are some exceptions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where do we go if we escape him?&#x201d; Cole asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;In the capital?&#x201d; Honor asked. &#x201c;We try to find Mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole had met Harmony. She had helped him escape Junction the last time he visited. &#x201c;Do you think she can help us find Mira?&#x201d; Cole wondered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; Honor said. &#x201c;I hope Mother can also direct us to Elegance. Our highest priority is to stop Ramarro, and we&#x2019;ll need help from Wayminders. Mother has contacts in that community.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole felt smothered by more than the hood covering his face. There was so much to be done! The prison where he had helped deposit Ramarro would not hold the torivor forever. It might only restrain him for weeks. Or even days. And if the torivor got free, the Outskirts would fall under his complete control. Not to mention that the torivor wanted revenge against Cole and his friends. The ancient shapers who had created the Outskirts had barely managed to contain Ramarro, and nobody was left who could defeat him. Cole had to find a way to prevent his escape.<br> <br>And he needed to find his friends, especially Mira, Jace, and Dalton. And his brother, Hunter.<br> <br>And he needed to rescue Jenna and the other kids who had been kidnapped into the Outskirts from his neighborhood in Arizona.<br> <br>And he needed to restore Elegance&#x2019;s power and defeat the High King.<br> <br>And he was currently tied up in a prison wagon.<br> <br>And his power didn&#x2019;t work right anymore.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s survive Owandell first,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a powerful shapecrafter,&#x201d; Honor warned. &#x201c;He can block the shaping of others. And we know with enough time he can strip away their powers and give them to another.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole temporarily wished he could return to the echolands, where he had gained so much power. Nobody in the echolands could chain him up and cart him around. Of course, it was also the last stop before moving on to the next phase of existence. Most people in the echolands were dead.<br> <br>Cole was back in the living world, and he had to solve his problems here. Or at least try.<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess we just have to be patient for now,&#x201d; Cole concluded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Save your strength,&#x201d; Honor suggested. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need it before long.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Weatherly Guide to Drawing Animals</h2><p>The WEATHERLY GUIDE TO DRAWING ANIMALS focuses on learning how to draw animals using solid drawing principles. The emphasis of the book is on learning to draw animals by understanding action,analysis of form, construction, expressive drawing, and simplified anatomy. An approach to drawing animals from life (a challenging and somewhat frustrating exercise) can be learned from the principles layed out in this book. <p>The importance of drawing from imagination and methods to go about it are also a key topic. THE WEATHERLY GUIDE TO DRAWING ANIMALS is geared toward all levels of artists from beginning to advanced. Anyone interested in learning how to draw animals or take their current animal drawing to the next level, will greatly benefit from this book.</p></p><p>Joe Weatherly is a Southern California based artist specializing in the drawing and painting of animals. His style is bold and vigorous capturing the essence and drama of the subjects he draws and paints. The attitude and expression of the animal s character along with telling a visual story is what his work conveys. Conservation of the natural world is something Joe is very passionate about and hopes his work will motivate people to protect it and promote its survival. Books that Joe Weatherly has published are the Weatherly Guide to Drawing Animals, Animal Essence the Art of Joe Weatherly, Animal Nature the Art of Joe Weatherly vol.2, and the Joe Weatherly Sketchbook. Teaching drawing is a part time endeavor of Joe s and some of his clients include Nickelodeon Animation, Dreamworks Feature Animation, Universal Studios, Art Center, Laguna College of Art and Design, and The Academy of Art in San Francisco. Joe is an associate member of the Society of Animal Artists, holds an M.F.A in Illustration from California State University Fullerton. He has also had one man Shows of his oil paintings at Ford Motor Companies Corporate Headquarters, California State University Fullerton and Galerie Daniel Maghen in Paris France. His drawings and paintings hang in private collections in Europe and North America.Welcome to the exciting world of animal drawing, a world where you can create your favorite creature through the use of line and tone. It is the hope that this book will take the mystery out of animal drawing by showing various methods and procedures used to draw them. Solid drawing principles necessary for strong draftsmanship is what this book is based on. Learning to draw animals well is both rewarding and challenging, and with a little study and dedication, you will be well on your way. <p>The book emphasizes solid drawing principles. I believe there is no better way to learn how to draw than by studying how the Great Masters went about it. Michelangelo, Rubens, and Da Vinci to name only a few, discovered and passed down methods of drawing that set the standard for solid drawing. Their drawings all had volume, anatomy, and motion, and these are key elements to good animal drawing. </p><p>No matter what your ultimate style will become, you must first learn the rules before you can break them. In other words, you can't cut straight to the chase and skip the fundamentals. It is the fundamentals of drawing that serve as a foundation in which to build upon. When the fundamental principles are not understood, the results are obvious. The drawings show a lack of true understanding. </p><p>So what are the drawing principles that I am talking about? Well these will be discussed throughout the book, but they all stem from the "Big 3": Action, Construction, and Anatomy. An understanding of these principles gives the artist the power to create drawings that are solid, expressive and full of life.</p></p><h2>Preparation for Death: Considerations on Eternal Truths</h2><p>SOME persons asked me to write a book on the Eternal Maxims, for the use of those who desire to establish themselves in virtue and to advance in a spiritual life. Others requested me to prepare a collection of matter for the sermons of the missions and of the spiritual exercises. Not to multiply books, labor, and expense, I resolved to compose the work in the present form, with the hope that it might answer both purposes. To render it useful as a book of meditations for seculars, I have divided the considerations into three points. Each point will serve for one meditation, and therefore I have annexed to each point affections and prayers. I entreat my readers not to grow weary, if, in those prayers, they always find petitions for the grace of perseverance and of divine love. For us, these are the two graces most necessary for the attainment of eternal salvation.</p><p>"Death viewed according to the senses terrifies and causes fear; but when viewed with the eyes of faith it consoles and becomes desirable. It appears terrible to sinners, but lovely and precious to the saints."<p> ~St. Alphonsus Liguori </p><p> In this popular abridgment of his monumental Preparation for Death, St. Alphonsus teaches the proper attitude toward Death, which is one of readiness; of always having one's "debts cleared." He cautions against letting even one day pass without reflecting on the certainty of death, the shortness of time and the length of eternity. Each chapter is a short consideration on some aspect of death, divided into three points easily understood by people in every state of life. Each point is followed by affections and prayers to help one persevere in his efforts to lead a holy life. St. Alphonsus prefaces each chapter with a quotation from Scripture designed to touch the heart of every reader. </p><p> Death is the one journey every man must go through alone. This book demonstrates how only consistent, thoughtful meditation on this reality can set people on a more resolute path to Holiness. </p><p> "The souls of the just are in the hands of God, and the torment of death shall not touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die; . . . but they are in peace." ~Wisd. 3:1</p>St. Alphonsus Liguori was born in 1696 to Neapolitan nobility at Marianella, Italy. He became a recognizable lawyer after going through law school at the age of sixteen, but later decided to leave law in favor of giving his salvation more attention. Alphonsus joined the Oratory of St. Philip Neri as a seminarian and was ordained in 1726, when he was thirty. The homilies he gave had the special ability of converting those who had fallen away from the faith. He also founded the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, and authored such works as <i>The Glories of Mary</i>, <i>The True Spouse of Jesus Christ</i>, <i>Attaining Salvation</i>, <i>The Blessed Virgin Mary</i>, <i>Preparation for Death Abridged</i>, <i>What Will Hell Be Like?</i>, <i>The Twelve Steps to Holiness and Salvation</i>, and <i>The Way of the Cross</i>.<br><br> After being a bishop for over a decade, St. Alphonsus Liguori died on the first of August, 1787. He was canonized by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839, and declared a Doctor of the Church in 1871. His feast is celebrated on August 1.</p><h2>Water Land: Land and Water Forms Around the World</h2><p><p>A lake turns into an island.<br>A cozy bay into a secluded cape.<br>A gulf with sea turtles transforms into a peninsula surrounded by pirate ships.</p><p>This unique information book for the very young switches between bodies of water and corresponding land masses with the simple turn of a page.

A young bear cub stumbles upon a little girl&#x2019;s tea party and really, really just wants a cookie, but tea party rules get in the way. The cub, who, unbeknownst to the girl, has knocked her stuffed bear off a chair and taken his identity, gets carted away as soon as the girl peers closely at him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too grubby,&#x201d; she says. Cub does not want a bath. However, he is groomed and then put in a dress and bonnet (&#x201c;Tea Party Rule: you must be neat&#x201d;). Soon Cub is seated at the table, and it&#x2019;s finally cookie time, but the rule to &#x201c;eat daintily&#x201d; is out the window. (He has his dignity, after all.) The tables are turned, perfectly so, when the little girl changes the game, and therefore the rules. Dyckman (Boy and Bot, 2012) and Campbell (Flora and Ulysses, 2013) are a winning pair, using their comedic chops to pace the story beautifully. Seeing Cub masquerading as stuffed, with feet sticking stiffly out and eyeballs wide, is laugh-out-loud funny. Campbell&#x2019;s soft sepia-marker-and-colored-pencil illustrations appear on creamy backgrounds, alternating humorous spots and detailed full-page spreads; the depictions of an unhappy bear ensure little ones are in on the joke. This battle of wills between two charmers hits just the right note.

I had a family, a home, and a job I enjoyed that allowed me to combine motherhood and a profession. I wondered what could possibly inspire me now. Well, I encountered the Angels and life has become a challenging, wonder-filled adventure where the bad moments, the nightmares, the falls from pride, the often shameful awakenings along with the surprising synchronicities, the awe inspiring dreams and visions and unexpected gifts turning up out of the blue lead to the knowledge that I am now empowered to cleanse my faults, purify my flaws, pay off some of my debts, transcend my distortions and develop pure qualities to rediscover my Divine self and to fulfill my purpose here on Earth. Detoxifying is not always very pleasant, but the benefits gained lead us to dreams beyond our imagination.

Its humorous title begins with the punch line of a classic joke about someone who is baffled by technology. It was written by a 40-year computer veteran who wants to take the mystery out of computers and allow everyone to gain a true understanding of exactly what computers are, and also what they are not. Years of writing, diagramming, piloting and editing have culminated in one easy to read volume that contains all of the basic principles of computers written so that everyone can understand them. There used to be only two types of book that delved into the insides of computers. The simple ones point out the major parts and describe their functions in broad general terms. Computer Science textbooks eventually tell the whole story, but along the way, they include every detail that an engineer could conceivably ever need to know. Like Baby Bear&#39;s porridge, But How Do It Know? is just right, but it is much more than just a happy medium. For the first time, this book thoroughly demonstrates each of the basic principles that have been used in every computer ever built, while at the same time showing the integral role that codes play in everything that computers are able to do. It cuts through all of the electronics and mathematics, and gets right to practical matters. Here is a simple part, see what it does. Connect a few of these together and you get a new part that does another simple thing. After just a few iterations of connecting up simple parts - voil�! - it&#39;s a computer. And it is much simpler than anyone ever imagined. But How Do It Know? really explains how computers work. They are far simpler than anyone has ever permitted you to believe. It contains everything you need to know, and nothing you don&#39;t need to know. No technical background of any kind is required. The basic principles of computers have not changed one iota since they were invented in the mid 20th century. &#34;Since the day I learned how computers work, it always felt like I knew a giant secret, but couldn&#39;t tell anyone,&#34; says the author. Now he&#39;s taken the time to explain it in such a manner that anyone can have that same moment of enlightenment and thereafter see computers in an entirely new light.</p><p>J. Clark Scott has had a long and diverse career in the computer industry, starting at large companies such as IBM and Intel, and eventually becoming the author of four successful consumer software packages. Early in his career, he noticed how confused some of his friends were about computers and gave them lectures to teach them how simple the basics really were. It was at that time that the idea for this book was born. This is his first book, but one that has been in the works for decades.</p><h2>Success Affirmations: 52 Weeks for Living a Passionate and Purposeful Life</h2><p>Jack Canfield is a master motivator, world-renowned teacher, and bestselling author of <i>The Success Principles</i>.

When you bombard your brain with colorful pictures, exciting details, and joyful emotions of what will be, a phenomenon called <i>cognitive dissonance</i> occurs in your mind. Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort&#x2015;the uncomfortable feelings&#x2015;you get when you hold two conflicting beliefs or ideas: (1) your life as you're living it today and (2) your life as you would like it to be in the future. When you continue the limiting behaviors that got you to where you are today or believe strongly that somehow you're not capable of getting what you want&#x2015;<i>then you suddenly begin using daily affirmations to visualize a better life</i>&#x2015;you create a form of mental tension that your brain will do everything in its power to resolve <i>by actually creating the better, more desirable lifestyle for you!</i></p> <p>Psychologist Leon Festinger, author of <i>A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance</i>, compares this process to how your brain reacts when you're hungry: It sends signals to your body to eat. In other words, it causes you to take necessary steps to resolve your hunger. In the same way, when you begin using affirmations to visualize your exciting new future with compelling pictures and emotions, your brain will likewise cause you to take those steps necessary to bring about that exciting new future.</p> <p>Bombarding your brain with thoughts of a better life through daily visualization and verbalization will actually force your brain to resolve the cognitive dissonance it dislikes. Affirmations are those highly visual and emotionally compelling statements you can use daily to visualize a better life.</p> <p>Everything great that has ever happened to humanity . . .has begun as a single thought in someone's mind.</p> <p>&#x2015;Yiannis Chryssomallis. Known professionally as Yanni, the composer, pianist, and music producer</p> <p><b>How affirmations can change your life</b></p> <p>Since you're reading this book, you've probably decided you want your life to be different in some way. Whether it's a more exciting career, better finances, loving and supportive relationships, world travel, more vibrant health, or just the luxury of a calm and organized life that works for you, there are steps you can take toward getting there.</p> <p>This book is about those steps.</p> <p>Not only does it include recommended affirmations to get you started on this powerful daily habit, it introduces you to a set of 52 powerful principles that the world's top achievers have used for decades to excel in business, the arts, sports, philanthropy, politics, and more. These are principles that I have studied, taught, and applied to my own life for nearly 40 years&#x2015;and that Ram Ganglani has used for three decades to achieve success in business, philanthropy, and private life. We've also seen these principles work in hundreds of thousands of lives besides our own. Using the framework of these proven principles, Success Affirmations is therefore not just a book of good ideas and positive thoughts, it's also a book of proven steps for creating success and happiness.</p> <p><b>These principles always work, if you always work the principles</b></p> <p>In fact, if you mastered just <i>one</i> principle a week, as this book will guide you to do, you could literally transform your life in just one year.</p> <p>But the key is that <i>you</i> must take responsibility for implementing these principles in your life. Creating a daily habit of reciting and internalizing your affirmations is just one of these principles&#x2015;which you'll find on page 45 entitled 'Week 10: Use Affirmations to Release the Brakes.' But make no mistake: you alone have to do the work of implementing these principles in your life&#x2015;you can't delegate them or skip over the ones you don't like. In fact, each one is integral to achieving overall success. It's just like writing a book. Before you can even start the process, you have to learn to read and write, you have to learn structure and syntax, you have to learn to put words into a sentence and sentences into paragraphs and paragraphs into chapters. If you leave a step out, the book will make no sense and readers will not benefit from it. Imagine a book with no periods or commas, no paragraphs or chapters! It just doesn't work.</p> <p>In the same way, each principle and its accompanying affirmations are key components to creating a successful and happy life. Your life. No one else can create your goals, build your dreams, and determine your future. Motivational philosopher Jim Rohn put it this way, 'You can't hire someone else to do your push-ups for you.'</p> <p>Whether you're exercising, setting goals, meditating, studying, or even sleeping, some things you just have to do for yourself to get any benefit from them. And like the principles I teach in this book and the affirmations you will use to instill those principles and their benefits in your consciousness, if you'll simply make a commitment to applying them week after week and stick with it, you'll reap extraordinary rewards.</p> <p><b>40 years of living these principles and affirmations prove that they work</b></p> <p>Albert Einstein once said, 'The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.' Affirmations are the tool that, day by day, will slowly change your thinking. Make even greater effort by implementing these principles in your life, and things will begin to happen that you never thought possible.</p> <p>It happened for me&#x2015;and this is Jack talking.</p> <p>Growing up in Wheeling, West Virginia, I lived in an average home. My dad was a workaholic and my mom, an alcoholic. I earned cash during summers working in my grandfather's florist business and as a lifeguard at the local pool. I made it through Harvard University on a partial scholarship&#x2015;serving breakfast at the campus dining commons to pay for books, clothes, and dates. During my last year of graduate school, I got a part-time teaching job that paid $120 every two weeks. That had to cover my rent and other expenses. To say that I was often broke would be an understatement. When money was tight, I survived on what I called my '21� dinners'&#x2015;a can of tomato paste, garlic salt, water, and a box of spaghetti noodles.</p> <p>�2017 Jack Canfield. All rights reserved.

When Chaz suspects that his wife, Joey Perrone, has figured out his scam, he resolves to push her overboard a cruise liner into the seething Atlantic. But if Chaz is a subpar scientist, he&#x2019;s an even worse killer. Joey, clinging blindly to a bale of Jamaican pot, is plucked from the ocean by a rugged stranger. Instead of rushing to the authorities, she seizes the opportunity to stay dead and, with her new friend&#x2019;s help, screw with Chaz until he screws himself. Add in an ill-tempered detective with a penchant for albino pythons, an oddly hirsute bodyguard addicted to fentanyl, and an unscrupulous boss growing uneasy about his lackey&#x2019;s increasingly erratic behavior . . . and Chaz&#x2019;s life is about to get a whole lot more interesting.</p><p>Charles "Chaz" Perrone fancies himself a take-charge kind of guy. So when this "biologist by default" suspects that his curvaceous wife, Joey, has stumbled onto a profitable pollution scam he's running on behalf of Florida agribusiness mogul Red Hammernut, he sets out right away to solve the problem--by heaving Joey off the deck of a luxury cruise liner and into the Atlantic Ocean, far from Key West. But--whoops!--Joey, a former swimming champ, doesn't drown. Instead, as Carl Hiaasen tells in his 10th adult novel, <i>Skinny Dip</i>, she makes her way back to shore, thanks both to a wayward bale of Jamaican marijuana and lonerish ex-cop Mick Stranahan (<i>Skin Tight</i>, 1989), and then launches a bogus blackmail campaign that's guaranteed to drive her lazy, libidinous hubby into a self-protective frenzy.<p> You've got to hand it to Hiaasen: He's perfected a formula for crisply written, satirical crime fiction that makes the best use of imaginatively repulsive villains, as well as less thoroughly venal scoundrels and victims who ultimately overcome their antagonists, all while stumping for the preservation of Florida's environment, particularly the Everglades. In <i>Skinny Dip</i>, we find Chaz (who'd rather be golfing than puttering around the "hot, buggy, funky-smelling and treacherous" reaches of nature) falsifying water samples to help Hammernut turn the 'Glades into "God&#x2019;s septic tank." That scheme, though, is endangered not just by Joey's sudden disappearance, but by the suspicions of a python-loving police detective and Chaz's own outstanding inability to tame his Viagra-enhanced tumescence. Even by assigning Chaz a baby-sitter--the hulking, hirsute, and painkiller-addicted Tool--Hammernut can't keep his pet biologist out of trouble. As Joey and Stranahan unfold their revenge plot, and Tool's conscience grows in competition with Chaz's ego, the reader can only marvel at the extent of the train wreck ahead.</p><p> As much fun as Hiaasen has delivering Chaz his climactic comeuppance, what's missing from <i>Skinny Dip</i> is a more complex, more credible development of Mick Stranahan's character and the relationship he builds with the much younger Joey Perrone. Like Erin Grant, from <i>Strip Tease</i>, Joey has far more going for her than her bra-cup size; but "hero" Stranahan is of far less interest here than any of his fellow players. <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>Chaz Perrone might be the only marine scientist in the world who doesn't know which way the Gulf Stream runs. He might also be the only one who went into biology just to make a killing, and now he's found a way&#x2013;doctoring water samples so that a ruthless agribusiness tycoon can continue illegally dumping fertilizer into the endangered Everglades. When Chaz suspects that his wife, Joey, has figured out his scam, he pushes her overboard from a cruise liner into the night-dark Atlantic. Unfortunately for Chaz, his wife doesn't die in the fall.<br><br>Clinging blindly to a bale of Jamaican pot, Joey Perrone is plucked from the ocean by former cop and current loner Mick Stranahan. Instead of rushing to the police and reporting her husband's crime, Joey decides to stay dead and (with Mick's help) screw with Chaz until he screws himself.<br><br>As Joey haunts and taunts her homicidal husband, as Chaz's cold-blooded cohorts in pollution grow uneasy about his ineptitude and increasingly erratic behavior, as Mick Stranahan discovers that six failed marriages and years of island solitude haven't killed the reckless romantic in him, we're taken on a hilarious, full-throttle, pure Hiaasen ride through the warped politics and mayhem of the human environment, and the human heart.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>A Picture Book of Martin Luther King, Jr. (Picture Book Biography)</h2><p><b>An introduction to one of the most outstanding Americans of the twentieth century, perfect for young readers. </b> <br><br>Born in 1929, Martin Luther King, Jr. grew up to become a civil rights leader whose philosophy and practice of nonviolent civil disobedience helped African Americans win many battles for equal rights.&nbsp; Young readers will learn how his interest in equality was sparked by experiences in his childhood, and how his legacy shaped modern America. <br><br>Pairing detailed illustrations and an accessible narrative of Dr. King's life, this book is ideal for a discussion about the history behind the holiday, or an early introduction to the struggle for civil rights in America.&nbsp; Includes a timeline of important dates. <br><br>For almost thirty years, David Adler&#x2019;s Picture Book Biography series has profiled famous people who changed the world.

Adler is the author of many popular books for children, including biographies, math books, and Judaica. His strong interest in history and biography led to his bestselling Picture Book Biography series. He lives in New York State with his wife and family.<br><br> Robert Casilla is the illustrator of several titles in David A. Adler's Picture Book Biography series, with subjects that include Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Jesse Owens. He lives in Connecticut.This book-and-cassette combination covers the main events and turning points of King&#39;s life and death. Both are dramatically portrayed through the vocal interpretation of the text, the illustrations and the various sound effects interjected during key scenes. One side has the sound of a turning page to cue the listener to turn the page. The other side contains the reading without page cues. The narrator clearly enunciates in a deep, strong African-American voice, steadily pacing his reading and allowing brief stops between pages. His pleasant, mild tone adds greatly to the presentation, providing the type of consistent performance so important for a young listener. P.A.J.

The dishes are named to double as affirmations of self. "I Am Fearless," "I Am Humble," and "I Am Open-Hearted" nod to the restaurant's core belief that food is just as much about spirit as it is about appetite. Since then, the caf� has evolved quite a bit. It's changed locations, expanded, and been the backdrop for more paparazzi shots than one can count. But the founding principles have remained the same, and the food continues to celebrate the flavors of plants with organic, from-scratch, and healthful ingredients free of animal products, processed soy, and, in almost all cases, refined sweeteners.<br><br>Now, with Love is Served, Seizan Dreux Ellis, executive chef at Caf� Gratitude, brings Gratitude-quality meals to your table and the soul and mission of the restaurant to your home. Indulge in caf� favorites "I Am Awakening" (Raw Key Lime Pie) and "I Am Passionate" (Black Lava Cake) while cooking up hearty, nourishing dishes like Grilled Polenta with Mushroom Ragout ("I Am Warm-Hearted") and Radicchio, Roasted Butternut Squash, and Sundried Tomato Pesto Grain Salad ("I Am Gracious"). With unfussy methods and easy-to-access ingredients, this cookbook makes the wholesome satisfaction of the restaurant as accessible as ever for the home cook as it charms and inspires readers to change the way they look at food.</p><p><b>Caf� Gratitude </b>is a vibrant global community of joyous gathering places where people come together to enjoy food and life.<br><br><b>Chef Seizan Dreux Ellis</b> oversees the development and execution of the organic, plant-based menu at all Caf� Gratitude restaurants in Southern California. In April 2012, Dreux came to Venice, California as Executive Chef of Caf� Gratitude in Southern California, bringing his health-based, flavor driven cuisine to a wider audience. In 2017, Seizan received lay ordination in the Soto Zen lineage of Shunryu Suzuki Roshi at the San Francisco Zen Center.</p>
